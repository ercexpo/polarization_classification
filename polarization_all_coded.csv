Mr. Trudeau’s Liberal Party will not retain its majority in Canada’s House of Commons, according to projections by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, but it will keep enough seats to allow Mr. Trudeau to form a government, with support from two left-leaning parties. The victory was a personal vindication for Mr. Trudeau, who battled accusations that he had bullied his former attorney general, an Indigenous woman, and faced damaging revelations late in the race that he had dressed in blackface and brownface as a young man. But these problems also clearly took a toll. The Liberals’ share of the popular vote fell throughout the country as it was losing its hold over the House of Commons.“It’s a reflection of the fact that the shine has come off the Trudeau brand,” said Andrew McDougall, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto. While Mr. Trudeau acknowledged early Tuesday morning “that it is always possible to do better,” his acceptance speech was victorious rather than repentant. “From coast to coast to coast, Canadians rejected division and negativity,” he said in Montreal. “For four years we have done everything we could to improve people’s lives and that is what we will continue to do.” Mr. Trudeau may have benefited from having an opponent, Andrew Scheer, leader of the Conservative Party, who lacked his star power. Mr. Scheer focused his campaign on Mr. Trudeau’s character — calling him a “fraud” who is “always wearing a mask” — rather than putting forward his own defining vision for the nation beyond cutting taxes. Mr. Trudeau’s return to office is a comeback of sorts for a man who was a celebrity from birth, as the first child born to a sitting Canadian prime minister, Pierre Elliott Trudeau. He has often been underestimated, and has consistently defied expectations since entering politics.His victory in 2015 was a surprise. His win on Monday, no matter how qualified, had been by no means assured. A charismatic figure, Mr. Trudeau came to power in 2015, touting himself as a new kind of politician — a self-proclaimed feminist committed to fighting climate change, open to refugees and dedicated to transparent, collaborative decision-making, what he called “sunny ways.” Mr. Trudeau must not only mend public opinion about his character but work with political rivals to advance his agenda. “Trudeau comes out of this likely relieved but chastened,” said Shachi Kurl, the executive director of the Angus Reid Institute, a nonprofit polling group. “If the last two years weren’t easy, it’s only going to get harder. Those sunny ways are just so past now.” At the outset of his political career, Mr. Trudeau captured the global imagination with his shirtless jogs, gravity-defying yoga poses and feel-good progressivism. “Canada is back,” he famously said when he came to power in 2015.During the campaign, crowds flocked to his events and to take selfies with him. In the end, voters appear to have concluded, even if reluctantly, that he was the best option to lead the country. Earlier this year, it appeared as if Mr. Trudeau would easily stroll toward a second term. Upon gaining power four years ago, he created a gender-balanced cabinet and stepped up efforts to make amends for Canada’s historical wrongs against Indigenous people. His government introduced significant changes. It legalized assisted dying and recreational marijuana, and it put forward a national carbon tax plan. Mr. Trudeau swiftly moved to admit 25,000 Syrian refugees, personally handing out parkas to some on their arrival. He stood up to President Trump, getting him to back down on steel and aluminum tariffs. Still, Mr. Trump tweeted his congratulations. Canada prospered during his term, with unemployment now at its lowest level in decades. To the public, those achievements seemed to have tempered disappointments, like a trip to India where the prime minister’s fondness for dressing in local ceremonial clothing embarrassed many back home. Other setbacks were a deterioration of relations with China and a broken promise to change how Canadians vote. Mr. Trudeau’s carefully groomed image began to shatter this year when his former attorney general and justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, accused him of improperly pressing her on how to handle a criminal corruption case against a major engineering company. The prime minister wanted her to use a new law to settle the case with a hefty fine, rather than pursuing a criminal conviction. He said he was trying to save jobs because a criminal penalty would have barred the company, SNC-Lavalin, from government work. But Ms. Wilson-Raybould, an Indigenous leader, said Mr. Trudeau and his mainly male aides had bullied her. Parliament’s ethics commissioner later found that Mr. Trudeau had broken conflict-of-interest laws. The clash undercut his promises to conduct politics in the open, without any back-room dealings. Mr. Trudeau eventually cast Ms. Wilson-Raybould out of the Liberal Party along with her former cabinet ally, Jane Philpott. On Monday, Ms. Wilson-Raybould was successful in her bid for re-election as an independent member of Parliament in Vancouver, British Columbia, a difficult feat in Canada. Ms. Philpott lost her bid to be re-elected in suburban Toronto. When the campaign officially began in September, Mr. Trudeau appeared to be bouncing back from the ethics controversy. But then old photographs of him dressing in brownface and blackface appeared. Longstanding questions about his character and authenticity resurfaced. Mr. Trudeau will not form a formal coalition with any of the three smaller parties in Canada. Instead he will rely on their support on a vote-by-vote basis. The Bloc Québécois, a party that promotes Quebec’s independence and that appeared near extinction at the beginning of the year, emerged with the third highest number of seats in the new House of Commons, the least expected outcome of the vote. Jagmeet Singh of the New Democratic Party, or N.D.P., the first nonwhite to lead a major Canadian party, struggled before the campaign and during its early days. While he caught the eye of many voters, the party ultimately collapsed in Quebec, its stronghold since 2011, and will be a smaller force in Parliament going forward. And the Green Party also failed to make a major breakthrough, with incomplete results indicating that it will gain one more seat, taking its total to three. The People’s Party of Canada, a new far-right movement, found no electoral success. Even its founder, the former Conservative foreign minister Maxime Bernier, lost his re-election bid. Early Tuesday morning before all the ballots had been counted, the Liberals held 156 seats, 14 short of majority. The Conservatives, led by Mr. Scheer, won 122 seats. As was the case in polls throughout the campaign, the two parties were roughly tied in the popular vote, with the Conservatives slightly ahead. Given the weakness of Liberals going into the campaign, analysts were already speculating that the disappointing result may now jeopardize Mr. Scheer’s hold on the party’s leadership. On Monday, however, Mr. Scheer acted more like a winner, telling supporters that reducing Mr. Trudeau’s grip on Parliament set the stage for a complete Liberal defeat in the next election, adding that the Conservatives had been given “an endorsement from the Canadian people that it was the government in waiting.” In the campaign, Mr. Scheer argued that he better understood and empathized with middle-class citizens, who are also the prime minister’s target audience. At a time when climate change topped voters’ concerns in many polls, Mr. Scheer pushed to cancel a carbon tax introduced by Mr. Trudeau and proposed a carbon reduction plan universally declared to be inadequate. An opponent of abortion who avoids gay pride parades, Mr. Scheer’s social conservatism evidently turned off many Canadians. But the campaign overall focused more on personalties and Mr. Trudeau’s shortcomings than the issues and became exceptionally acrimonious, experts said. Lori Turnbull, a professor of political science at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, said the lack of constructive political debate and focus on childish name calling was nothing less than “tragic.” “It shocks me that this has been one of the most policy-void elections that we’ve ever seen,” she said. “The narrative of the campaign has been leaders taking swipes at one another and trying to find ways to get people to not trust the other person.”",CR,,0,||,0,||,0,||

They’re All Hanging Out Together,"Katie Herzog was a largely unknown freelance journalist living in Seattle. Then she published an article in The Stranger about trans people who halt or reverse transitions. Two days later she started getting hate mail. “It is, by far, the most-read thing I’ve ever written,” Ms. Herzog said. It also made her “wildly reviled.” Seattle residents burned stacks of The Stranger and posted stickers calling Ms. Herzog a transphobe. Ms. Herzog lost “dozens” of friends over the article, she said. She soon felt unwelcome at lesbian bars. She began to hesitate to give strangers her name. She felt like a “pariah” in her hometown, she said, and eventually moved out of Seattle to the Olympic Peninsula in Washington. Her main social contacts now are her live-in girlfriend and a small group of older female friends. “I’m not invited to brunch anymore,” Ms. Herzog said. The term for people who have been thrust out of social or professional circles in this way — either online or in the real world or sometimes both — is “canceled.” This week, even Barack Obama spoke about online denunciation, personal purity and being “politically woke,” saying, “If all you’re doing is casting stones, you’re probably not going to get that far.” There are varying degrees of cancellation. Bill Cosby, R. Kelly, Harvey Weinstein and other men have been canceled for serial sexual assault or harassment; non-famous abusers and predatory media executives have been canceled as well. The merely offensive (Roseanne Barr, Shane Gillis) are somewhere down the scale, adjacent to the provocative or clueless or callous (Dave Chappelle, Scarlett Johansson). At the bottom end, cancellation consists of some mild, inconsequential criticism. On YouTube, vloggers cancel each other and even themselves with startling regularity, often for petty or invented grievances. Ms. Herzog became a member of a unique emerging class of people — journalists, academics, opinion writers — canceled for bad, conservative or offensive opinions. As it happens, cancellation is bringing many of them together. Here Is the Attention We All Ordered Alice Dreger, a former Northwestern University professor, estimated she has counseled “about 100” people through their experiences being canceled. In doing so, she has become part of an “informal peer network” that includes two pugnacious writer-personalities: Christina Hoff Sommers, who rose to prominence defending Gamergate and coining “victim feminism,” and Meghan Murphy, who opposed adding gender identity to Canada’s human rights act. Ms. Herzog had interviewed Ms. Dreger for her piece on trans people. “I told her, ‘You’re going to get slaughtered for this.’ She just laughed,” Ms. Dreger said. “Six months later, she gave me a call.” “Katie thought what we all thought: The truth will save me. That’s what Galileo thought, too, and he died under house arrest. The same thing has happened to us.” Ms. Dreger is neither dead nor under house arrest, but she has become a resource for the canceled because of her 2015 book, “Galileo’s Middle Finger,” about when intellectuals are vilified. (In part, it recounts the story of J. Michael Bailey, who endorses a theory called “autogynephilia” as a factor in gender transitions; many trans people say that tying their identity to sexual arousal is offensive.) Ms. Dreger’s chief concern is ensuring that the canceled person has access to mental health care, she said. The experience of public scorn is psychologically damaging. “There’s an effect to being constantly told, in public, that you’re wrong and evil,” said Kathleen Stock, a professor of philosophy at the University of Sussex in England. Ms. Stock has also received strong criticism for her writings on trans people. (She describes herself as “gender critical.”) She said she is “anathema” in certain philosophy factions. She has also corresponded with Ms. Herzog and Jesse Singal, another journalist who has been scorned for his writing on trans people, and has developed genuine friendships with like-minded academics. “Some of us have even been on holiday together,” Ms. Stock said. The Cancellation Media Ecosystem “I’m an ambulance chaser for the canceled,” joked Jonathan Kay, an editor of Quillette, an online publication that touts itself as a defender of free speech and has emerged as a home for the canceled to plead their cases. Ms. Stock used Quillette to reassert her views. “I’ve found defending myself in print is the best thing I can do to feel better by myself,” she said. Mr. Kay clarified that Quillette will not publish just anyone, however. “Being canceled is like autism — it’s a spectrum,” he said. Harvey Weinstein would be a “no” for him. “We’re much more interested in the opposite end of the spectrum, where you have people who have been accused of things that are much less serious, and don’t nearly approach a criminal level,” Mr. Kay said. Readers want to hear from the canceled, but the larger motivation is philosophical. Quillette’s editorial point of view is that so-called cancel culture is overly punitive and lacks nuance. “When I went to law school, in the ’90s, the presumption of innocence was seen as a progressive value,” Mr. Kay said. “Because who is mostly wrongly accused of crime? Racialized minorities. Blacks, Hispanics, the poor. More often than not, it protects marginalized communities. And now the presumption of innocence is seen as a conservative value. And that troubles me.” Bridget Phetasy hosts the “Walk-Ins Welcome” podcast, which she said “has become the island of misfit toys.” The show has featured people like Andrew Doyle, a British comedian, and Mitchell Sunderland, a freelance writer who was fired from Vice. “I don’t see myself as someone who’s been canceled as much as someone who’s willing to sit down and associate with the canceled,” Ms. Phetasy said. “I’m an ally of the canceled.” She is also friends with Art Tavana, who has the dubious distinction of having been maybe-canceled twice. In 2016, he wrote an ode to the sex appeal of the pop musician Sky Ferreira for LA Weekly. (The editor of the article apologized.) Mr. Tavana’s second cancellation came at Playboy in 2018; he was hired as a conservative columnist. “My three best friends straight up told me, ‘I don’t want to talk to you anymore,’” he said. “One friend, we had known each other since kindergarten.” Playboy, he said, decided that he was not a good fit for its more progressive look. His ouster spurred a kinship with Ms. Phetasy, a fellow former Playboy columnist.“We both felt like we had been shoved out for not being woke enough,” Mr. Tavana said. Her podcast has also featured Dave Rubin, who has created a media organization, the Rubin Report, around his cancellation. “My show has become a hub for misunderstood or canceled people or to-be-canceled people to express themselves honestly,” Mr. Rubin said. Mr. Rubin began his digital media career in 2013 at The Young Turks, a leftist news organization, but branched out on his own in 2016. “Suddenly all of these people who were being lambasted in the media came on my show, and we became legitimate friends,” Mr. Rubin said. He did a tour with Jordan Peterson, a psychology professor turned motivational speaker. Mr. Rubin also regularly dines with Peter Thiel, the libertarian venture capitalist, and is friends with Ben Shapiro, who is against abortion and diversity but for Ted Cruz. On Mr. Rubin’s show, Mr. Shapiro said that organizations should be able to refuse service to same-sex married couples on religious grounds, and that straight couples are better parents than gay couples. (Mr. Rubin lives in Los Angeles with his husband.) Obviously, Mr. Rubin declined to cancel Mr. Shapiro. “We can remain friends and agree to disagree,” Mr. Rubin said. “I believe in the long game: If you show people respect, then some of these guys who are religiously against gay marriage, they’ll probably come around because they’ve met some decent gay men.” This association with right-wing figures has cost Mr. Rubin several friendships, including with people who attended his wedding. Mr. Rubin says he is happier being canceled. “Woke progressives are a pretty miserable bunch,” he said. “Try joking with that group.” The Intellectual Gray Area Meghan Murphy and Cathy Young used to square off regularly on Twitter. “She wrote some really nasty things about me,” Ms. Young said. Ms. Murphy called Ms. Young a “virulent anti-feminist” and an apologist for men’s rights activists. But they buried the hatchet at, yes, a Quillette party in Toronto. “She basically said that she really came to understand the importance of letting people have their own opinions, even if some people consider them offensive,” Ms. Young said. That Quillette party is also where Ms. Murphy met Jamie Kilstein, a comedian who was fired from a progressive radio show after a number of women accused him of sexually predatory and emotionally abusive behavior. “We hated each other on Twitter,” Ms. Murphy said. “And he was at the Quillette party, and I said, ‘Hey!’ And he was like, ‘Hey!’” Mr. Singal also connected with Mr. Kilstein. “I probably would have been too scared to get breakfast with Kilstein before I dealt with this,” Mr. Singal said. Mr. Singal has written frequently on trans people in ways that have upset vocal members of that community. His stature has only grown, including on Twitter, where he mocks woke culture and identity politics. He is one of many who simultaneously talk about their cancellation experience while also noting that they also haven’t really been canceled. “I have lost Twitter friends, but I haven’t lost real-life friends,” he said. “My friends are normies.” On Oct. 28, completing some kind of circle, he appeared on Quillette’s podcast, discussing his experience. (He also appeared on the podcast in January.) “The experience of seeing an insane caricature of yourself pop up online makes you more sympathetic to anyone else who has been through this thing,” he said. Mr. Singal and Ms. Murphy may be case studies for people who don’t believe “cancel culture” is real, or effective. Twitter-based outrage hasn’t had a lasting, adverse effect on their careers or social lives. It has become a central part of their online personas. For Ms. Murphy, getting canceled has brought her into contact with people she once considered her “political enemies.” She was banned from Twitter for “targeted misgendering” and then sued Twitter over the decision. (She lost the suit but said she is currently in the appeal process.) While she thought it would hurt her writing career, she said the opposite occurred. “People tried to cancel me, and I was un-cancelable,” Ms. Murphy said. “It backfired, and I gained a bigger profile.” She was defended by “people I never would have considered and talked to before — anti-feminists, men who think feminism is stupid and it’s about hating men,” Ms. Murphy said. Mr. Shapiro reached out to her to offer his support. The Canceled-Adjacent Problematic Club In May 2016, Mandy Stadtmiller wrote a first-person essay about her husband being a supporter of Donald Trump. She was inundated with messages urging her to divorce him. She lost a couple of “close” friends. She grew increasingly disillusioned from the New York media clique she was once eager to join. “It was crazy-making to have a lot of people telling me, ‘You’re wrong, you’re wrong, you’re wrong,’” Ms. Stadtmiller said. She also experienced a “chill in work,” she said. “Some of the top decision makers at different media outlets very much made it clear they were not as excited to use me as they once had been,” she said. “There’s never been a ‘Mandy Stadtmiller is canceled’ party,” she said. “I look at it as being — I don’t know what the word is. ‘Canceled adjacent,’ maybe.” She also found solace in speaking with Ms. Herzog and Mr. Sunderland, whom she had known for a while. But the closest relationship Ms. Stadtmiller formed was with Keri Smith, a self-identified former “social justice warrior.” Ms. Smith was a leftist comedy producer. She was an executive producer of “Totally Biased With W. Kamau Bell,” which is what she calls “the first SJW late night show.” (“SJW” stands for “social justice warriors.”) Then she wrote an essay for Medium: “On Leaving the SJW Cult and Finding Myself.” Ms. Stadtmiller traveled to stay with Ms. Smith for a month, in her home north of Austin, Texas. “I actually helped her turn it into an Airbnb!” Ms. Stadtmiller said. “I need friends like I need oxygen. So in reaching out to people who wouldn’t start screaming at me because I was Eva Braun or something, I developed richer, more real friendships.” Who Runs the Culture? The social cost of associating with the canceled can be greater than being canceled, said Andrew Doyle, the British comic. People remain silent. Mr. Doyle runs a parody Twitter account about identity politics and cancel culture. He said his work has been described as “racist” and “misogynist.” (“I’ve had one friend literally scream at me in the pub,” he said.) He reached out to Lisa Hardcastle when her similar Twitter account was suspended in 2018. Now they, too, are friends, and attend shows at a comedy club Mr. Doyle founded, where the operating ethos is “no self-censorship.” “In any witch hunt, the people who get the worst treatment are the ones who try to defend the witches and not the witches themselves,” he said. “Anyone who’s read ‘The Crucible’ knows that.” Cancellation does present a question about power, and who has it. “The biggest problem we have as a culture is that we can’t define who the establishment is,” Mr. Tavana said. “Is the establishment the woke media people who own 99 percent of the keyboards in the country, or is it the old, canceled guys in media? Who’s the punk rock band and who’s the corporate rock band?” Mr. Rubin imagines a near future where everyone is canceled for 15 minutes. “The woke progressives are going to implode, and pretty soon they’ll destroy everything,” he said. “It’s just a matter of how much will they take down with them. They’re going to cancel Barack Obama one day, because Obama ran against gay marriage at one time.” Mr. Shapiro said, “Our culture is dying because we have no capacity for forgiveness or discussion.” That Which Does Not Kill Them “There have been attempts to cancel me, but I cannot be canceled, because I refuse to be canceled,” Ms. Herzog said “I’ve certainly lost a lot of friends and had a lot of abuse online and damage to my reputation and livelihood,” Mr. Doyle said, “but that’s not the same thing as being canceled. I’m still able to do the work I want to do. If you retreat away, it makes you the victim. We don’t want to be considered victims.” “They can’t cancel you if you don’t care,” Ms. Phetasy said. “My cancellation, if you want to call it that, has been the greatest thing to ever happen to me,” Mr. Rubin said. “SJWs don’t have friends, they have allies,” Ms. Smith said. “And your allies leave as soon as you’re not speaking the ideology anymore.” Ms. Murphy describes her cancellation as “a gift.” As Ms. Herzog has begun to advise other people through their cancellations, her advice to them is to embrace being canceled. “It’s deeply painful, but it can be positive in many ways,” she said. “Before this happened, I was much more dogmatic, I was more of a purist. I’m smarter, I’m more skeptical, I’m more empathetic, and I’m much less quick to judge than I was before. And I’m much less sure of my own correctness.” “Which is why I hope everyone is canceled,” she said.

How Can They Afford That When I Can’t?,"I’ve done it and you probably have, too: looked at a neighbor or friend who seemed to be in roughly the same financial bracket and wondered, “How do they do it?” How do they afford the elaborate remodel and the luxury vacations they’re bragging about on their Instagram accounts and the private school tuition? The feeling is envy, but it’s mixed with curiosity. And it often comes with a large dollop of self-criticism. They somehow must be better at managing their money than my husband and me. What are we doing wrong? Just look at a forum on the popular financial blog Mr. Money Mustache. The question asking whether “the ‘everybody seems wealthy’ illusion — is it really just fueled by debt?” attracted a wide variety of opinions, but more than a few expressed the sentiment of the commenter GeorgeC. “I often have this struggle where it seems as if everybody around me is wealthy,” he wrote, adding that he often wondered how people he knew earned as much or less than he did could afford things he could not. “To be honest, at times, it kind of makes me feel dumb and sometimes even like a failure at what I do,” he added. No doubt, most people could improve how they handle their finances. But better money management isn’t usually the culprit: When people seem to be able to afford much more than their income would suggest, it’s often because there is hidden wealth or hidden debt. “Wealth is even more hidden than income, because there’s no job to correlate,” it to, said Dalton Conley, a professor of sociology at Princeton University. We have a general idea what a professor or corporate lawyer makes, but “in terms of family wealth, there’s zero cues.” Ellen, who lives in the Washington area, knows that feeling of envy and curiosity. Like everyone else talking about their personal experiences for this article, Ellen (her middle name) spoke on condition of anonymity in order to publicly share her private thoughts about friends’ spending habits. For years, Ellen watched her friends, who had similar jobs and the same number of children as she did, spend much more lavishly on just about everything compared with Ellen’s family. They did expensive home additions. They took twice as many vacations to places farther away. They drove nicer cars. And she felt bad about it, assuming she and her husband were simply worse financial managers. “We go to self-blame when we don’t know the whole story,” she said. Then it all collapsed. It turned out that the family was largely living on debt. They were under water on their house and had to sell it. They’re now renting an apartment. “I did feel very vindicated,” Ellen said. “I guess we weren’t doing anything wrong.” Of course, not all people who seem to be living beyond their means are running up their credit cards. Sharon (not her real name), who lives in Westchester County, N.Y., has relatives who have paid her children’s full college tuition and give the family additional help. She doesn’t like sharing that with people, “a little bit because I’m protecting the image of my husband that he rolls with the big boys,” she said. “And I also feel really lucky and it doesn’t feel fair. I’m not comfortable, but I’m thrilled we have it.” Editors’ Picks When Will It Be Safe to Sing Together Again? Evoking History, Black Cowboys Take to the Streets New York City’s Kettlebell Shortage: ‘People Are Kind of Freaking Out’ Frederick Wherry, also a professor of sociology at Princeton University, recognizes that sentiment. “One of the things that helps to protect us as we’re trying to make our way through life is that we rely heavily on secrecy,” he says. “We’re really trying to protect our understanding of who we are and other people’s understanding of who we are.” I identify with that feeling. My parents contributed to our sons’ university tuition and while I may mention it when discussing college costs, I certainly don’t highlight it. I’d rather be seen as someone disciplined and savvy enough to sock away hundreds of thousands of dollars for eight years of college than as someone relying on parental assistance. So I am part of the problem. Not only do people want to play down their inherited wealth or money from family “but they actively try to hide it,” Mr. Conley said. “We have this ideology of individualism and worshiping of the self-made man or woman.” And theoretically, there’s a correlation between getting more because you work harder, said Evan Polman, a professor of marketing at the University of Wisconsin at Madison School of Business. “Inheritance is a violation of that correlation.” So, why does this matter? What if we don’t know where our neighbors got the money for that new deck? Few would want everyone’s financial status to be transparent. But this secrecy helps reinforce the idea that it is only individual choices, not laws and policies, as well as our national history, that comes into building wealth. “It seems like a straight-up cultural issue, but public policy plays a role in how we view secrecy about money and also the consequences that secrecy has,” said Mr. Wherry, who is also director of the Dignity and Debt Network. People need to understand others are in a similar situation — struggling to pay for college or retirement or health care — to realize it’s not a personal failing and to push for reforms. “That’s what we need to fix the problem,” he said. “If it’s just about you, nothing’s going to change.” These issues most likely play out differently in affluent areas compared with low- and moderate-income communities, where “you’re probably much more aware of the struggle that neighbors are feeling,” Mr. Wherry said. “Yes, we need to be responsible, but there’s much more of a sense that there are things that go well beyond me as an individual that affect how we live.” “The secrecy surrounding money may also differ to some extent in countries with higher rates of unionization,” Mr. Conley said, “where salaries are more transparent.” Some say we’re focusing on the wrong thing if we’re looking at the outward signs of wealth. The reality now is that if we’re going to envy our neighbors, it shouldn’t be for their BMW or new swimming pool. It should be for their fat 401(k) or gold-plated health insurance, because the ability to put away large amounts of money to secure our future and our children’s future is the sign of real wealth now. The top 1 percent of households still spend money on conspicuous consumption but “the thing that really separates them is their spending on inconspicuous consumption,” said Elizabeth Currid-Halkett, a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California, who analyzed Americans’ spending habits for her book “The Sum of Small Things: A Theory of the Aspirational Class.” Over the last few decades, wealthy people have increased how much of their spending they direct to education and retirement, compared with members of the middle class, whose expenditures in those areas have remained more or the less the same. For example, in 2014, the last year of Ms. Currid-Halkett’s analysis, the top 1 percent of American earners — those making at least $340,000 annually — directed, on average, 6 percent of their total expenditures to education. According to her research, that percentage has climbed significantly since 1996. Only about 1 percent of the expenditures of the middle class — people making about $40,000 to $60,000 annually in 2014 — was devoted to education, a number that has stayed static for almost two decades, Ms. Currid-Halkett said. And about 20 percent of the top earners’ expenditures go to personal insurance and pensions — an annual average of $32,500 in 2014 — compared with just under $4,000 or about 8 percent for the middle class. “The change in spending patterns among the rich are probably the biggest signifier of class divide in America today,” she said. No doubt, some will scoff at people comparing themselves to their neighbors and offer the advice that they should just focus on their own lives. And there’s some sense in that. But competitiveness and inquisitiveness are part of being human. Charles (his middle name) who lives in the metropolitan Phoenix area, said he speculated about friends who seem to spend and spend and spend with no visible income coming in. “They do things that absolutely leave my wife and I scratching our heads,” he said. “I would consider our lives completely fine. But I do think people look at all these types of people around the country and wonder: ‘How are they doing that? How can they afford it?’” ",VC,,0,,0,,0,

Matt Bevin of Kentucky bowed to the inevitable and conceded after a recanvass of votes showed clearly that the Democrat Andy Beshear would be the state’s next governor. Mr. Bevin had alienated many in both parties, describing some of those who protested his policies as “ignorant” and “selfish,” and leaving even political allies feeling insulted and bullied. Public school teachers, who were particularly angered by his approach, said openly that they had knocked on thousands of doors across the state to defeat Mr. Bevin. He lost by more than 5,000 votes in a year when every Republican on the state ticket won easily and after President Trump campaigned for him on the night before the election. “We’re going to have a change in the governorship based on the vote of the people,” Mr. Bevin said to the crowd of reporters and others gathered outside his office in the Capitol, who were unsure up until the last minute whether the governor would acknowledge defeat or fight an increasingly solitary crusade to contest the election. His fellow Republicans, who conspicuously did not swarm to Mr. Bevin’s defense when he began alleging widespread voting irregularities without presenting any evidence, were candid about the reason for his downfall. “This race did not turn on policy,” said Robert Stivers, the State Senate president and a Republican, in an interview this week. “If it had been on policy he would have won hands down. What it turned on was personality. And his comments and rhetoric basically fatally wounded him from a political standpoint.” The defeat came after Mr. Bevin, among the least popular governors in the country, had wrapped himself in the mantle of Mr. Trump, whose fervent advocacy for Mr. Bevin did not work out as either of them had hoped. And it now raises expectations for the final governor’s race of the year, the Louisiana election on Saturday. Mr. Trump has inserted himself on behalf of the Republicans in all three governor’s elections in cherry-red states this year. In the two that have taken place so far, the results are split. While Mr. Bevin lost, the Republican in Mississippi, Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves — the least endangered of the three — won. Now all eyes are on Louisiana, where the Democratic incumbent, John Bel Edwards, is trying to survive a challenge from Eddie Rispone, a Republican businessman. Mr. Rispone has explicitly styled himself after Mr. Trump, who is campaigning for him. In his concession speech on Thursday, Mr. Bevin thanked his staff, trumpeted the successes of his term and wished the best to Mr. Beshear, the son of a former two-term Democratic governor. He concluded his speech by criticizing the voting process as insufficiently transparent in the age of electronic voting machines, and continued to maintain that there had been improprieties in the election, just not enough to affect the outcome. As it happened, Mr. Beshear’s margin of victory remained unchanged after the recanvass, according to the secretary of state: 5,136 votes out of more than 1.4 million cast. Mr. Beshear delivered a sort of second victory speech after Mr. Bevin’s concession. He began by thanking the governor but also made remarks clearly meant to differentiate his style from Mr. Bevin’s. “I believe that we can change the tone as we have seen it in Frankfort,” he said, “that we can be an example not just for the state but maybe even for the nation on how we can move forward on areas that we can agree on and how we can civilly disagree on areas that we might not have common ground.” Though his final words were largely positive, Mr. Bevin had kept up his pugnacious style to the last days. At a conservative youth conference this past weekend in California, he talked about people who aim “to hijack our political process,” who are talking of Russia collusion while “at the back gate robbing us blind.” He denounced electronic voting as unaccountable and spoke ominously of voting by noncitizens and dead people — “multiple times even.” Fellow Republicans, however, had made clear that they were ready to move on. “I think the right course is easy to determine,” Jason Nemes, a Republican legislator from Louisville, said this week, “and that’s to concede the race unless you have significant and specific evidence of illegal votes that were cast for the opponent.” Mr. Bevin had never provided such specific evidence, instead simply raising doubts more generally about the integrity of the process. In announcing the results of the recanvass shortly after Mr. Bevin’s concession, the outgoing secretary of state, Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat, rebutted such claims by pointing out the decentralized administration of Kentucky elections, which are essentially 120 different elections, one in each county. “By no means is there any vast conspiracy to hurt one candidate or party,” she said to reporters. “This is a process that depends on a lot of people. Its decentralization is its greatest asset.” Kentucky had already begun preparing for a new administration before Thursday’s news, with construction of the inauguration platform underway at the State Capitol building. Mr. Beshear has named the grand marshals of his inauguration parade, and both he and Mr. Bevin said on Thursday that their teams had already been working together on transition matters. The House Republican caucus has invited Mr. Beshear to its annual retreat to discuss areas of possible policy agreement. This transition had been going on quietly despite the scheduled recanvass, which Mr. Bevin had requested and which, given the relative closeness of the election, many Kentuckians felt was justifiable. While it was hard to find people who supported a prolonged challenge beyond this, as Mr. Bevin had been indicating, a recanvass is a relatively easy and straightforward procedure. The process on Thursday morning was hardly gripping, unfolding in the 120 counties across the state much as it did in the third-floor conference room at the Scott County Courthouse in Georgetown, Ky. Pulling envelopes out of a plastic bin, Rebecca M. Johnson, the county clerk, read the vote totals, one precinct at a time, to a handful of county officials gathered around a conference table, along with the county sheriff, a local Democratic Party official and a couple of observers from the Bevin campaign. After winning Scott County handily in 2015, Mr. Bevin had come 97 votes short last week. It was among the closest margins in Kentucky. After about 45 minutes of reading totals, and a few more minutes’ talk of weather and basketball over the rattling of adding machines, Mr. Beshear’s victory margin in Scott County was, again, 97 votes. Bobby McDowell, 61, chairman of the Scott County Democratic Executive Committee, who sat in on the recanvass, had doubted from the start that anything would change. But he was sure that he and most people in Kentucky, including Republicans, were ready for this election and all the business that followed to come to a definitive end. “Everything’s got to have an amen,” he said.

Two months later, New Jersey State Police responding to a crash in the same county discovered illegal assault weapons in the back seat of a car. Later, they found 17 more firearms, a grenade launcher and neo-Nazi paraphernalia in the driver’s home. The arrests of the two men rocked law enforcement officials in Sussex County, raising fears that far-right extremism is growing in this sleepy, rural area in New Jersey. It is impossible to know if the two arrests so close together are a fluke or signal of a growing white supremacist movement in the county, law enforcement officials said. The two men appear to have no connection to one another. Sussex has lately been seeing ugly signs of increasing racism and anti-Semitism. Vandals have scrawled swastikas in schools, and in a highly-publicized incident last fall, supporters of a Jewish congressman had their Sussex County home vandalized with anti-Semitic graffiti. Bias-related crimes rose from four in 2016, when President Trump was elected, to seven in 2018, prosecutors said. Though the numbers are small, officials say the general upward trend is still troubling in a county of only 141,000 people, and reflects similar increases across the state. “One hundred percent certainty, the numbers of reports have increased,” said New Jersey state Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal. “I can’t say that belief system is isolated to Sussex. We’ve seen it in all parts of the state.” At the same time, there has been a rise in right-wing extremism across the country. White supremacists and other far-right extremists have killed more people than any other category of domestic extremist in the past 18 years. In August, for example, a white supremacist targeting Mexicans murdered 22 in a Walmart in El Paso. Only recently have federal law enforcement officials come to grips with that threat, and local prosecutors like those in Sussex County have often found themselves doing investigations they are ill equipped to undertake. Law enforcement officials said neither of the men arrested recently in Sussex County had contact with each other or other white supremacists in the area. Instead, they appear to have been independently radicalized. Gregory Mueller, an assistant prosecutor in Newton, N.J., said it is highly likely there are others with a similar ideology in the county, but he is not sure how to find them. His investigators lack the expertise to ferret them out. Until recently, for instance, Mr. Mueller and his team were not familiar with an image found on one suspect’s social media profiles: Pepe the Frog, a widely recognized, racist meme used by the far right. For now, the county has just one computer forensics expert, Detective Marty Lewis, who spends nights and weekends trawling far-right internet forums for clues. “City departments get so many resources from the feds to track these groups,” Mr. Mueller said. “We have Marty down in the basement.” Sussex as a case study Tucked along New Jersey’s western border, Sussex County is rural and mostly white, though over the last five years there has been a small but steady increase in the number of immigrants living there. President Trump easily carried the county in 2016. For roughly a century, the county was a conservative stronghold, the anchor of New Jersey’s reliably Republican 5th Congressional District. But redistricting in 2010 added towns from the heavily Democratic eastern part of the state, and in 2016, the district elected a moderate Democrat, Josh Gottheimer, to Congress. He was the first Democrat elected to the seat since 1933. Not long after, his office was spray-painted with swastikas. The incident was part of a troubling rise in anti-Semitic, racist and far-right graffiti, county officials said. The phenomenon tracked with what was happening across the country after the 2016 election in counties with similar demographics. In the first two quarters of 2019, there was a 40 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents compared to the same time period in 2016, according to statistics provided by the Anti-Defamation League. “I think the national rhetoric is not helping,” said Jared Maples, the director of the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security. “That discourse leads to people feeling disenfranchised and on the fringe and again, empowered, maybe, to make their voices heard about the hate that they kind of espouse and believe in.” Mr. Gottheimer has been repeatedly targeted with graffiti — during the midterm election a supporter’s lawn sign was covered in Nazi symbols — but the most frequent targets have been the district’s schools: Swastikas have been found at schools in Glen Rock, Ridgewood, Emerson and the Pascack Valley. Mr. Gottheimer noted that other hate groups like the Oath Keepers and the Ku Klux Klan were gaining a foothold in his district. “The concern is those acts of hate are the embers and then they begin to get radicalized,” he said. ‘They’re there. We just don’t know who they are.’ Law enforcement officials said that Michael V. Zaremski, the 25-year-old arrested after his ex-girlfriend complained of harassment, appears to be a prime example of the self-radicalized threat they fear may cause damage in the future. “They’re there,” said Detective Lewis, the computer forensics expert. “We just don’t know who they are.” Mr. Zaremski was an emergency medical technician who frequented white supremacist forums online and had a trove of neo-Nazi literature. He was only caught because he sent a photo of his ex-girlfriend wearing parts of a Nazi uniform to her employer, officials said. The police later discovered that he had made videos set in New Jersey that mimicked, shot-by-shot, the first minutes of the live-streamed massacre of Muslims by a right-wing terrorist in Christchurch, New Zealand. He had also stockpiled automatic weapons, each with the same markings on the gun magazines as the Christchurch shooter, according to sources familiar with the investigation. Indeed, Mr. Zaremski was so obsessed with the mass shooting in New Zealand that he made his former girlfriend watch the video of the shooting repeatedly, investigators said. He also affixed a “Right Wing Death Squad” patch to his E.M.T. jacket. Law enforcement officials discovered material on his computer that suggested he was curious about committing a mass shooting at a hospital. The way Mr. Zaremski became radicalized has become the new normal, law enforcement officials and experts on hate groups said. More and more alienated young people are adopting extreme ideologies in online forums and chat rooms, rather than joining traditional groups like the Ku Klux Klan. “The online world is just as important to us as looking at real world activities,” said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s intelligence project, which tracks hate groups. “There’s essentially no distinction. And rooting people out from an online perspective is a very difficult thing for law enforcement, because you don’t have a group to infiltrate.” An intelligence gap Unlike Mr. Zaremski, Joseph Rubino, the 57-year-old man arrested after he crashed his van on a country road, appeared to have been on the radar of federal law enforcement for some time before he was taken into custody in August, one law enforcement official said. A lapsed member of a motorcycle gang, Mr. Rubino was believed to be selling homemade semiautomatic guns and handing out far-right propaganda at gun shows in the region, officials said. Still, Mr. Rubino was never arrested by federal agents. Instead, he was picked up by the state police, who arrived at the scene of the crash in August and spotted banned firearms in the back seat of the wrecked van, according to court documents. A subsequent search of Mr. Rubino’s home turned up a grenade launcher, 17 semiautomatic weapons and racist and anti-Semitic materials. Mr. Rubino was charged in federal court with possessing illegal weapons. Had he not wrecked his car, Mr. Mueller said, Mr. Rubino might still be frequenting gun shows. “If you look at how we were able to arrest Zaremski and Rubino, they were both by happenstance,” said Mr. Mueller. “It’s not like we had this massive yearlong investigation and these were the two that we found.” A wider problem Sussex County’s quandary is a symptom of a bigger issue, years in the making: The F.B.I. no longer has a deep reservoir of intelligence on far-right threats, current and former law enforcement officials say. For years, there was a de facto policy within the Justice Department to defer prosecutions of far-right groups to state and local authorities, as the F.B.I. shifted resources toward Islamic terrorism after the Sept. 11 attacks, said Michael German, a former F.B.I. officer who worked undercover inside white supremacist groups in the 1990s and early 2000s. It was not until recently, as the threat from right-wing extremism flourished and the threat from Islamic extremism waned, that the flaws in that strategy became clear. Deferring those cases to local authorities meant there was no longer a national repository of data and information on far-right groups, Mr. German said. “It means the federal government loses all that intelligence,” he said. “If there was a crime in Des Moines, Iowa, and a crime in Springfield, Ill., and a crime in Minnesota, they might never know that those crimes are actually connected.” Mr. Zaremski was engaging regularly with other far-right ideologues, Mr. Mueller said, but none of them appeared to be within Sussex County’s jurisdiction, or even the state’s. Pursuing such cases would require help from federal law enforcement. “They do assist,” Mr. Mueller said of the F.B.I. and other agencies. “But it typically will take us reaching out to them on a case or person.” Mr. Grewal, the state attorney general, has revised bias and hate crime standards and encouraging prosecutors to report any suspicious activity. Since that directive, the reports have increased by 300 percent across the state. “In the wake of Parkland, we saw that there were gaps in reporting,” he said, referring to the school shooting in Miami that left 17 dead. But local law enforcement is still behind in infiltrating right-wing groups, Mr. Grewal said.

This also shows us that Trump isn’t just 100 percent committed to self-preservation, but that he’s willing to take hostages to guarantee it. That’s not to say that impeachment won’t be difficult—or that it won’t further inflame our already smoldering culture war. Even absent Trump’s burn-it-all-down mentality, impeachment would still be traumatic. We already have enough irritants and stressors in our lives, so it’s understandable that the public might not want to add one more. Ironically, the threat of roiling the nation is probably most concerning to people who are temperamentally conservative or moderate—the kinds of people who crave normalcy and tranquility. But should the fear of additional stress be a deterrent? If so, this argument could be invoked to prevent any action that might serve as a corrective. The victim of violence who goes to the police is, in a sense, inviting more trouble. He does so, at least partly, to prevent the next person from being victimized by the same assailant. The patient who opts for chemotherapy is, to some degree, inviting a season of chaos and pain into her life. She does so because she has decided to fight, and because she sees it as a short-term sacrifice for a possible long-term benefit. Trump’s apologists want to scaremonger about starting a civil war, but blaming those of us who want to hold the president accountable for things he did is sort of like blaming the fire department for kicking down your door after an arsonist (who plays with matches) catches your house on fire. But we don’t have to invent new metaphors to illustrate the flaws in Trump’s argument. Since he irresponsibly invoked civil war, it’s probably fair game to note that, from time to time, America has had to endure terrible tests in the pursuit of freedom and justice. Yes, we actually did fight a bloody Civil War to end slavery. The cost was incredibly high. We did it because it was worth the fighting for. Happily, almost nobody really thinks impeachment will devolve into a shooting war. But it is going to get ugly. The preservation of democracy is inherently messy. Keep in mind the “civil war” threat is a distraction from the fundamental question, which is whether Trump used the prestige of his office to coerce a foreign leader to dig up dirt on one of Trump’s political rivals—and whether that is an impeachable offense. Since it’s pretty hard for a Trump supporter to argue that Trump’s behavior was appropriate, then he must argue something else. One such something else is: “Yeah, but impeachment will rip this country apart.” Unlike the notion that Trump acted appropriately, this is at least a plausible argument—if for no other reason than that it is a self-fulfilling prophesy. It becomes true if Trump and his defenders decide to make it true. There’s an old saying that goes, when you’re right, argue the facts, and when you’re wrong, argue the law. Donald Trump and his sycophants added a third component to this formulation: When you’re really desperate, threaten to shoot the dog. Unfortunately, in this case, the dog is America.

Will he ever willingly leave the White House? Trump’s retweet may have seemed to casual observers to have come out of nowhere. But it didn’t. Right-wing sites have been full of chatter about civil war and a coming race war for some time, and Trump’s rhetoric is pouring gasoline on an already-lit fire.The Baptist preacher whose “civil war” quote Trump tweeted is Robert Jeffress, pastor of a Dallas megachurch, who is a regular guest of the president, both at Trump rallies and in the White House as one of Trump’s advisers on matters related to evangelicals. During the 2016 campaign, Jeffress served on Trump’s “Evangelical Advisory Board.” Jeffress is not a fringe figure, and the views he voices cannot be dismissed as too far out to be credible. He is a Fox News contributor, and his full quote from which Trump drew his tweet aired on Fox News after Speaker Pelosi announced the Democrats would proceed with an impeachment inquiry. It read: “I have never seen the Evangelical Christians more angry over any issue than this attempt to illegitimately remove this President from office, overturn the 2016 election, and negate the votes of millions of Evangelicals in the process. They know the only impeachable offense that President Trump has committed was beating Hillary Clinton in 2016. That’s the unpardonable sin for which the Democrats will never forgive him. If the Democrats are successful in removing the president from office, it will cause a Civil War-like fracture in this nation from which our country will never heal.” The Civil War has long been a theme on the right. We saw it surface in Charlottesville in 2017 with the violent clash between white supremacists and protesters—and Trump’s subsequent insistence that there are “fine people on both sides.” With Trump facing likely impeachment, he is stirring these hatreds into service on his behalf. “We’re seeing the number one guy on the right in the country amplify the theme and magnify it,” says Adele Stan, who edits Right Wing Watch for the liberal advocacy group People for the American Way (PFAW). “We’re likely to see it just proliferate on an even greater level in the Twitter universe and on social media and in comments on Fox News,” Stan told the Daily Beast. ADVERTISING “The treason talk has also exploded,” she said, following Trump’s accusations of treason against Democrat Adam Schiff, who chairs the House Intelligence committee, and Trump’s likening of the whistleblower at the heart of the Ukraine controversy to a spy. What Stan sees now as she monitors right-wing sites and commentators is the traditional veneration of the Civil War combined with excited talk of a new looming armed conflict. “Some are saying the left will start civil war, others say the left will precipitate civil war because they will push the right to the brink,” she says. Of special concern are tweets on the account of the Oath Keepers, a neo-militia group made up of current and former law-enforcement officers. “This is the truth. This is where we are. We ARE on the verge of a HOT civil war. Like in 1859. That’s where we are. And the Right has ZERO trust or respect for anything the left is doing. We see THEM as illegitimate, Stuart Rhodes, leader of Oath Keepers, tweeted on Sept. 29. On Tuesday, radio host Sandy Rios, who is the governmental affairs director with the American Family Association (AFA), took on Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger for calling Trump’s retweeting of a civil war trope “repugnant.” Founded in 1977, the AFA is a legacy organization that commands respect on the right, insuring that no other Republicans would follow Kinzinger’s lead. The Illinois congressman didn’t support Trump in 2016, saying, “I am an American before I am a Republican.” Explaining her criticism of Kinzinger on her popular morning show, Rios said, “Because I don’t think it takes a rocket scientist to understand that the tensions are growing in this country so much so that there is a divide that’s setting in that is much like a precursor to any civil unrest.” This enthusiasm for a looming civil war crosses many sectors on the right. Pastor Jeffress represents the religious hold it has on evangelicals. The secular right, represented by Infowars, along with numerous secular YouTubers on the right regularly use this ominous portent. Television evangelist Jim Bakker, widower of Tammy Faye Bakker—yes, that Jim Bakker, from the 1980s; he’s still around—has a program on YouTube on which he preaches End Times and has people who follow him storing food in their basement for the apocalypse to come. Evangelist Franklin Graham said in an interview with the Christian Post earlier this year, “If the president were brought down for any reason, it could lead to a civil war.” Radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh says we’re in a “cold civil war.” And conservative darling Michelle Malkin warned at CPAC (Conservative Political Action committee) in March that civil war is imminent. “Our enemies are both foreign and domestic,” she said, singling out the “radical left” waging violence against the right from TV green rooms and Beltway backrooms and corporate boardrooms and conference ballrooms. Stan used a phrase I hadn’t heard before: “stochastic terrorism,” which Wiktionary defines as “the use of mass public communication, usually against a particular individual or group, which incites or inspires acts of terrorism which are statistically probable but happen seemingly at random.” Stan cited Pizzagate as an example of stochastic terrorism, where one young man took it upon himself to “rescue” children allegedly held in the basement of a D.C. restaurant by Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager, John Podesta. Preposterous, you say; the restaurant didn’t even have a basement. But one person believed it and showed up with a gun. Fortunately he was stopped before he could do any real damage, but the point is that if you plant the seeds of an idea in the minds of your followers, someone will pick up on the suggestion that there are conditions that need to be resolved—while your hands are never dirty. I asked how this might work with Trump’s more incendiary tweets, and Stan said she could not possibly know how he does what he does, but that she thinks people “feed him certain tweets,” and that he’s “quite cunning. He knows if he retweets somebody, it will go viral and it will enliven that part of his base. Whether it’s pre-meditated or a visceral impulse for self-preservation, it’s what he does.” More conspiracy theories will take hold as Trump fights for his political life. “Whether or not the narrative is true almost doesn’t matter anymore,” says Stan. “The right wing will flood the zone and the base will swallow it hook, line, and sinker. And the political reporters will feel compelled to write about it. It’s just about getting the narrative out there.” And getting the voters to throw up their hands in disgust. That’s the response Trump wants. That’s how he wins. He can’t be allowed to get away with it. We have a president of the United States who is inciting civil war. The party of Lincoln is silent. That has to change if the Republic we all love is to survive and thrive",VC,,1,"If the Democrats are successful in removing the president from office, it will cause a Civil War-like fracture in this nation from which our country will never heal.|. “Some are saying the left will start civil war, others say the left will precipitate civil war because they will push the right to the brin|“This is the truth.

It’s also a step beyond the generic explanation that Russia was out to sow “chaos” in American politics. A team of Kremlin-connected trolls spent years impersonating Americans across Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Tumblr, Twitter, and elsewhere to destabilize the internal politics of Russia’s foremost geopolitical adversary. They knew what to exploit. One indictment involving the so-called Project Lakhta cited a co-conspirator explaining they were to “aggravate the conflict between the minorities and the rest of the population.” They fed white supremacy to a white audience already on a grievance binge. They pretended to be an American Muslim organization. They amplified reactionary sentiments involving immigration, gun rights, and veterans, demonstrating how well they understood the fulcrums on which American politics precariously balanced. Years before Trump’s impeachment, they threatened civil war in the event of his removal from office. St. Petersburg-based troll farm the Internet Research Agency also understood the power of social media platforms with a depth that eluded their ownership. Facebook initially dismissed the impact of the trolling, only to admit by November 2017 that 150 million Americans were exposed to it across Facebook and Instagram. It spurred a seismic backlash to the obscenely wealthy companies. Once adored, now they were summoned to Capitol Hill to answer for their role in hollowing out democracy. And while the efficacy of the Russian propaganda initiative might never be precisely quantified, broadcasting propaganda across Mark Zuckerberg’s empire cost the Internet Research Agency only $46,000. Even when they used broken English, they were fluent in Internet. One imposter account on Twitter, @ten_gop, interacted with Donald Trump Jr., Michael Flynn, and Fox News. What started on the internet did not stay there. As The Daily Beast first reported, they used Facebook to organize real Americans into attending rallies in 17 cities. Some, in Florida and Pennsylvania, were explicitly pro-Trump. Trolls also pretended to be civil-rights activists to get Americans protesting police violence. Last year, then-special prosecutor Robert Mueller indicted 13 people for their involvement in the propaganda effort. Following the release of the documents, the committee’s vice chairman Mark Warner (D-VA) added that their findings also suggest the Kremlin has not ceased its propaganda efforts. “I cannot stress this enough: the Committee found that Russia’s efforts continue to this day,” he tweeted. “In fact, we found that this activity increased, rather than decreased, after Election Day 2016.” While senators offered cautious praise for the FBI’s efforts at tackling foreign influence in the years since the election, the committee called it “troubling” that the FBI monitored Russian social media influence campaigns “mostly through contractors” during the 2016 campaign. The contractor the FBI used sampled just one “overtly pro-Russian network of 13 Twitter accounts and their followers” and the Bureau never communicated any of the underlying analysis to Twitter. The subject of Russian meddling in elections after 2016 is still apparently a sensitive subject as broad sections of the report’s discussion of “ongoing IRA activities” were redacted. Going forward, the intelligence committee wrote that foreign propagandists could exploit new technologies to once again catch the intelligence committee off guard as Russia did with its use of social media in the 2016 election. In particular, senators expressed concern that the use of “deepfake” video technology will create “more realistic and convincing propaganda material” and “advanced micro-targeting” which could allow foreign propagandists to more effectively target audiences within the U.S. ",VC,,1,"“By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016.” ||",1,"“By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016,” the panel concluded.|One indictment involving the so-called Project Lakhta cited a co-conspirator explaining they were to “aggravate the conflict between the minorities and the rest of the population.” |While senators offered cautious praise for the FBI’s efforts at tackling foreign influence in the years since the election, the committee called it “troubling” that the FBI monitored Russian social media influence campaigns “mostly through contractors” during the 2016 campaign.",1,"“By far, race and related issues were the preferred target of the information warfare campaign designed to divide the country in 2016,” the panel concluded.|One indictment involving the so-called Project Lakhta cited a co-conspirator explaining they were to “aggravate the conflict between the minorities and the rest of the population.” |They amplified reactionary sentiments involving immigration, gun rights, and veterans, demonstrating how well they understood the fulcrums on which American politics precariously balanced"

Over 900 people perished that day, more than a third of them children. As he lay dying of a bullet wound to the head—a less painful way to go than cyanide and one that he probably orchestrated—Jones told his followers that it was “all the media’s fault. Don’t believe them.” Those words, uttered so long ago, sound disturbingly familiar as we approach the 41st anniversary of Jonestown. We have a president who regularly disparages and blames the media, calling it “fake,” “false,” and “phony,” and who calls journalists “enemies of the people”—epithets that seem especially frenzied in the wake of the whistleblower complaint and the launching of the House impeachment inquiry. It might seem an outrageous proposition to compare Donald Trump to a murderous cult leader. And yet there are alarming parallels. Like Jones and other cult leaders, Trump exhibits features of what psychologist Erich Fromm called “malignant narcissism”—bombastic grandiosity, a bottomless need for praise, lack of empathy, pathological lying, apparent sadism, and paranoia. In short, he fits the stereotypical psychological profile of a cult leader.I have seen that profile up close. Over 40 years ago, while a junior in college, I was recruited into a destructive mind control cult, the Unification Church, popularly known as the Moonies after its leader, Sun Myung Moon. I rose rapidly through the ranks and was invited to attend meetings with Moon and his top aides, where we knelt and bowed to our leader Moon. Two years later, after three days straight of leading a fundraising team—selling flowers on street corners—I fell asleep at the wheel and woke up as I plowed into the back of an 18 wheeler. Fortunately, I survived. My family hired deprogrammers and, after five days, I realized I had been brainwashed. Since then, I have devoted myself to studying mind control cults and helping families rescue loved ones from their clutches. I have learned that mind control is not a vague, mystical process but, instead, is the result of a concrete and specific and systematic set of methods and techniques. Cult leaders may seem crazy, but they are cunning masters of manipulation, employing an arsenal of these techniques to render their followers dependent and obedient. It’s what I call the cult leader’s playbook. As I argue in my upcoming book, The Cult of Trump: A Leading Cult Expert Explains How The President Uses Mind Control (Simon & Schuster), Trump has gotten where he is today in large part because he has exploited tactics straight out of that playbook. These include his grandiose claims, his practice of sowing confusion, his demand for absolute loyalty, his tendency to lie and create alternative “facts” and realities, his shunning and belittling of critics and ex-believers, and his cultivating of an “us versus them” mindset. These are the same methods used by Moon, Jones, and other cult leaders such as L. Ron Hubbard (Scientology), David Koresh (Branch Davidians), Lyndon LaRouche (LaRouche PAC), and, most recently, convicted trafficking felon Keith Raniere (NXVIM). Of all these tactics, the “us versus them” mindset is probably one of the most effective. From the moment you are recruited into a cult, you are made to feel special, part of an “inside” group in opposition to unenlightened, unbelieving, dangerous “outsiders.” Playing on ancient human tribal tendencies, cult leaders extend this “us versus them” mindset outwards to an almost cosmic struggle. Many campaigns—political, military, athletic—pivot around the idea of conflict between parties. Even in literature there is a hero and a villain. But cults take this human habit of viewing the world in binary terms and infuse it with a kind of all consuming passion, which they reinforce in the minds of followers using cliches, platitudes, lies, and endless repetitions. You come to believe that you are superior to the rest of the world. In fact, everyone who is not in the group is, at some level, in the words of the eminent psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton, dispensable. In the Moonies, we were told that we were heavenly soldiers engaged in a great struggle to take the world back from the forces of Satan, which included godless Communism and human-centered Western democracy. Our ultimate goal was to replace these godless human-centered forms of government with a god-centered theocracy, under Moon’s leadership. Jones, a self-professed Marxist, told his followers—who were often poor, black, and disenfranchised—that the enemy was racism, capitalism, and the American government. He took his followers to the wilds of Guyana to escape the clutches of the U.S. government, which was evil and out to get him. For Hubbard, the enemy was psychiatrists and governments, and also non-Scientologists. He used a racist term to describe the latter—wogs—and essentially argued that they were inferior to true believers. For LaRouche, it was a global conspiracy consisting of the Queen of England, Wall Street, Jews, and various intelligence agencies, such as the CIA. He and his followers wanted to defeat this evil cabal that was destroying the world, which only LaRouche could save. Trump paints his enemies with a much broader brush. At rallies, he bounds on stage and tell his audiences how special they are—“I love you Indiana”—but it soon becomes clear that he has no “love” for anyone but Trump supporters. During his 2016 campaign, he would single out members of the audience—and even journalists—who he perceived as hostile and eject them, often to deafening cheers from his supporters. Shunning, humiliation, and ostracism are common methods for demonstrating who counts as “us,” and what needs to be done about “them.”As did LaRouche, Moon, and Jones, Trump sees a world teeming with enemies: the “deep state,” globalists, radical left-wing Democrats, socialists, Hollywood actors, the liberal media. And, of course, Muslims, Mexicans, and migrant caravans. He depicts all of them as wanting to destroy America—and him. Inspiring or creating fear of real or imagined threats overrides people's sense of agency. It makes them susceptible to the confident father figure, Trump, who promises to keep them safe—“Only I can fix it”—and makes them more compliant and potentially obedient. Some followers of Trump have gone so far as to believe that liberal Democrats, George Soros, and the CIA are involved in an international sex trafficking ring run out of the basement of a Washington, D.C., pizza parlor. One such follower actually brought an AR-15-style rifle into the pizza parlor and fired three shots. Fortunately, no one was injured.When I was in the Moonies, I was so indoctrinated that I was prepared to take up arms and die for the cause. I wasn’t alone. My fear is that Trump might order his followers to take their weapons to the streets if he is not re-elected. In a recent tweet, he quoted his Christian Right ally, Robert Jeffress, that his removal from office “will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.” Worse still is the possibility that, if feeling sufficiently threatened, Trump might, like Jones, try to take others everyone with him, using his access to the nuclear codes. It’s a dark scenario, but not entirely outlandish. The good news is, I woke up and got out of a cult, as have millions of people. What I have learned in working with cult members, as I describe in my book, is that attacking their beliefs is doomed to fail. To help them recover their critical faculties, it is essential to develop a warm and positive relationship before teaching them about how mind control works. I often do that by showing how it operates in other groups, like the Jonestown cult or Scientology. We might use the same approach to heal the “us versus them” mindset of Trump’s followers—and also of some of their more rabid opponents. Ultimately, the goal is to educate and inspire people to regain their capacity for critical thinking, and to free their own minds. I have seen people throw off the mental and emotional shackles of many years—even a lifetime—of destructive conditioning. I believe that love is stronger than fear and that truth is stronger than mind control. But I also believe that the dangers of mind control are greater now than ever due to the digital world we are so plugged into. We ignore the lessons of history—of Jonestown and other destructive groups—at our own peril.",VC,,,,1,"We have a president who regularly disparages and blames the media, calling it “fake,” “false,” and “phony,” and who calls journalists “enemies of the people”—epithets that seem especially frenzied in the wake of the whistleblower complaint and the launching of the House impeachment inquiry. |Like Jones and other cult leaders, Trump exhibits features of what psychologist Erich Fromm called “malignant narcissism”—bombastic grandiosity, a bottomless need for praise, lack of empathy, pathological lying, apparent sadism, and paranoia.|These include his grandiose claims, his practice of sowing confusion, his demand for absolute loyalty, his tendency to lie and create alternative “facts” and realities, his shunning and belittling of critics and ex-believers, and his cultivating of an “us versus them”  mindset.",1,"Take It From a Former Moonie: Trump Is a Cult Leader| It might seem an outrageous proposition to compare Donald Trump to a murderous cult leader.

This conventional view is rubbish. The most powerful force in American politics today is anti-establishment fury at a rigged system. There are no longer ""moderates."" There's no longer a ""center."" Today's great divide is not between left and right. It's between democracy and oligarchy. Four decades ago, when America had a large and growing middle class, the left wanted stronger social safety nets and more public investment in schools, roads and research. The right sought greater reliance on the free market. In those days, a general election was like a competition between two hot-dog vendors on a long boardwalk extending from the left to the right. Each had to move to the middle to maximize sales. If one strayed too far left or right, the other would move beside him and take all sales from the rest of the boardwalk. This type of American politics is now obsolete. As wealth and power have moved to the topand the middle class has shrunk, more Americans have joined the ranks of the working class and poor. Most Americans – regardless of whether they were once on the left or right -- have become politically disempowered and economically insecure. Nowadays it's the boardwalk versus private jets on their way to the Hamptons. As Rahm Emmanuel, Obama's chief of staff and former mayor of Chicago, told TheNew York Timeslast July, ""This is really the crackup. Usually fights are Democrats versus Republicans, one end of Pennsylvania versus the other, or the left versus the right. Today's squabbles are internal between the establishment versus the people that are storming the barricades."" In 2016, Trump harnessed many of these frustrations, as did Bernie Sanders. If anything, the frustrations today are larger than they were then. Corporate profits are higher, as is CEO pay. Markets are more concentrated. The three richest Americans now have more wealth than the bottom half of the population put together. Yet most peoples' pay has gone nowhere and they have even less job security. Meanwhile, Washington has become even swampier. Big corporations, Wall Street, and billionaires have entrenched their power. Trump has given them all the tax cuts, regulatory rollbacks, and subsidies they've wanted. Why doesn't the rest of America rise up in protest against Trump's virulent attacks on American democracy? Because American democracy was dysfunctional even before Trump ran for president. The moneyed interests had already taken over much of it. It's hard for many Americans to get very excited about returning to the widening inequalities and growing corruption of the decades before Trump. Which partly explains why Biden is foundering. At the same time, Trump and his propagandists at Fox News have channeled working-class rage at the establishment into fears of imaginary threats such as immigrants, socialists, and a ""deep state."" But large majority of Americans – right and left, Republican as well as Democrat -- could get excited about moving toward a real democracy and an economy that worked for the many. This is why the oligarchy is so worried about Elizabeth Warren's rise to frontrunner status in some polls. Politicoreports that Democratic-leaning executives on Wall Street, in Silicon Valley and across the corporate world are watching her with an increasing panic. ""Ninety-seven percent of the people I know in my world are really, really fearful of her,"" billionaire Michael Novogratz told Bloomberg. These Democratic oligarchs hope Biden, or perhaps Pete Buttigieg or Sen. Amy Klobuchar, can still take Warren out. In just the third quarter, Buttigieg raised around $25,000 from executives at finance firms including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and hedge fund giants like Bridgewater, Renaissance Technologies and Elliott Management. And another $150,000 from donors who described their occupation as ""investor."" If Biden implodes and neither Buttigieg nor Klobuchar takes the lead away from Warren, Wall Street and corporate Democrats hope former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will ride into the Democratic primary at the last minute. It won't work. The stark reality is that Democrats cannot defeat Trump's authoritarian populism with an establishment candidate who fronts for the oligarchy. The only way Democrats win is with an agenda of fundamental systemic reform, such as provided by Warren and also by Sanders. Unless Democrats stand squarely on the side of democracy against oligarchy, they risk that on Election Day too many Americans will either stand with Trump or stay home.",CR,,0,||,1,"Robert Reich: 2020 is About Oligarchy vs. Democracy—and There's Only One Choice Here That Will Allow the Democrats to Win |There are no longer ""moderates.""

Or Because Voters Are Sheep?,"Poll(s) of the week Public support for impeaching President Trump has gone up significantly over the last two weeks. And a big part of that increase comes from Democrats; about 79 percent support impeachment as of Thursday evening, according to the FiveThirtyEight average, up from about 72 percent before the Ukraine scandal broke.1 That raises an interesting question: Did Americans, particularly Democrats, decide on their own that Trump pushing the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter crossed into impeachable behavior? Or is the public following the views of elites, with a sizable bloc of Democrats embracing impeachment only after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and almost the entire party got on board? The two events — news of the president’s phone call with Ukraine and congressional Democrats deciding to start the impeachment process — happened in quick succession, so we may never be able to untangle the exact causal threads. But the safest assumption doesn’t really require much untangling: It likely took both factors to move public opinion so suddenly. What evidence do we have that the Ukraine news itself shifted opinion? Well, we’ve seen just as big a jump in support for impeachment among independents as Democrats — and presumably independents don’t care as much about the views of either party’s leaders.2 Polls also show that Americans say they are concerned about the Ukraine scandal. A Quinnipiac poll found 50 percent of voters said Trump had “done something wrong” in his interactions with the Ukrainian president. And an ABC News/Ipsos survey found that a clear majority of respondents said that it was a “very serious” (43 percent) or “somewhat serious” (21 percent) problem that Trump “encouraged the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.” Then again, these measures — support for impeachment among independents and Americans’ views of Trump’s actions — are themselves likely influenced by elites, particularly the media. (I think the media is more clearly covering the Ukraine controversy as “Trump did a bad thing” than it did the Russia investigation.) Moreover, there’s a fair amount of political science research suggesting that voters are more tied to their parties than to their issue positions. For example, when Democratic Party leaders decided to support same-sex marriage, many Democratic voters who opposed gay marriage simply changed their position, rather than leave the party. The rise of Trump displayed the same dynamic, as many Republican voters who used to be wary of Russia and care deeply about the moral values of politicians abandoned those views to align with their party’s leader. So the increase in Democratic support for impeachment after Pelosi and more moderate Democrats got on board fits that broader pattern. Why does it matter what exactly caused this shift in public opinion? Well, if people change their minds about something largely because of new facts, that’s fairly intuitive and not particularly surprising. Perhaps impeachment became more popular largely because Trump did something that was clearly bad and, unlike special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe, fairly easy to understand. But if impeachment got more popular largely because Democratic voters, and some independents, are taking cues from party leaders, that’s more interesting. If voters are basically lemmings following the dictates of their party’s leaders, fairly unpopular ideas can in theory become more popular — and perhaps popular ideas can become less popular. Pelosi often says that she is weighing public opinion as she makes her decisions. But what if politicians, particularly someone in a high-profile role like Pelosi, are shaping public opinion as they react to it? For example, Biden, Pelosi and centrist Democrats in Congress are wary of a Medicare for All health care system (as opposed to keeping the existing system, but letting some people enroll in a Medicare-style health care option if they choose). And polls suggest Medicare for All is not particularly popular with voters, even among Democrats. But if key leaders in the Democratic Party got behind Medicare for All — or even a more unpopular idea, like reparations — would most Democratic-leaning voters start supporting it, thus significantly raising its overall popularity in a country that is divided fairly evenly between the two parties? Conversely, if Biden becomes the Democratic nominee, does single-payer health care become even more unpopular among Democrats, since he will be the party’s standard-bearer and has made his opposition to the policy clear? I’m sure there are limits to how much party leaders can move the voters in their parties. But it’s worth thinking about this dynamic as you read poll results and watch how politicians react to them. Other polling bites 47 percent of Americans think race relations in the country are worse than they were a year ago, according to a new AP-NORC poll. The poll found 33 percent of Americans approve of the way Trump is handling “race relations,” compared to 65 percent who disapprove. This result breaks along racial lines: 43 percent of white Americans approve of Trump’s actions on race relations, compared to 16 percent of Hispanics and 5 percent of blacks. 32 percent of likely voters in California say they would back an upcoming referendum to overturn a recently passed law in the Golden State that eliminates cash bail, according to a new Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll; 39 percent want the law to stay in place, and 29 percent are undecided. 77 percent of adults in the United Kingdom and 75 percent in Canada support a universal basic income program meant to help people who lose jobs because of technological advancements, according to a recent poll conducted by Gallup and Northeastern University. Support for such a UBI program was much lower in the United States, at 43 percent. According to a new Pew Research Center poll, 62 percent of Americans think that social media companies have too much control over the mix of news that people see. That includes majorities of respondents who identify as Republican or Republican-leaning (75 percent) as well as Democratic or Democratic-leaning (53 percent). Federal agencies like NASA (81 percent favorable), the National Park Service (86 percent) and the U.S. Postal Service (90 percent) are almost universally popular among Americans, according to a new Pew poll. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (52 percent unfavorable) and the Department of Education (48 percent unfavorable) are the least popular agencies. Fewer than 1-in-4 Americans (23 percent) think the economy will improve over the next year, according to CNBC’s latest All-America Economic Survey. That’s a three-year low. A Seton Hall Sports poll found that Americans support student-athletes making money by almost a 2-to-1 margin. Sixty percent favored allowing them to “profit from the use of their name, likeness or image” while 32 percent were opposed. Only 34 percent of Americans approve of Trump “as a person,” according to a new Gallup poll. The same survey found the president’s job approval at 40 percent. Trump approval According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker, 41.2 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 53.9 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -12.7 points). At this time last week, 42.8 percent approved and 53.2 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -10.4 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 41.5 percent and a disapproval rating of 54.0 percent, for a net approval rating of -12.5 points. Generic ballot In our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 6.9 percentage points (46.9 percent to 40.0 percent). At this time last week, Democrats led by 6. 8 percentage points (46.8 percent to 40.0 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 6.3 points (46.4 percent to 39.7 percent).",CR,,1,"If voters are basically lemmings following the dictates of their party’s leaders, fairly unpopular ideas can in theory become more popular — and perhaps popular ideas can become less popular.|But if key leaders in the Democratic Party got behind Medicare for All — or even a more unpopular idea, like reparations — would most Democratic-leaning voters start supporting it, thus significantly raising its overall popularity in a country that is divided fairly evenly between the two parties|",1,"That raises an interesting question: Did Americans, particularly Democrats, decide on their own that Trump pushing the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter crossed into impeachable behavior?

It went like this: “Let’s say you’re a conservative person. You orient your life around faith, family, community, decency, patriotism, modesty, honesty, charity, frugality, and human dignity... and your heroes are... Donald Trump, Rush Limbaugh, and Rudy Giuliani?” With the curtain set to open on a new week of impeachment hearings, the only noble players in this drama seem to be the “deep state” bureaucrats whom we are supposed to fear and hate. Indeed, one positive thing to come out of impeachment has been the chance to highlight the unheralded dignity and professionalism of the men and women who have quietly sacrificed so much for the cause of freedom—behind the scenes. Compared to Trump and his apologists, the contrast is stark. To help explain this, I have been asking friends to engage in the following thought experiment: Whom would you trust to check in on your family if you were away on business for a couple weeks? Whom do you want your kids to grow up to be like? For the sake of argument, this is a binary choice. On one side are people like Donald Trump, Rush Limbaugh, and Rudy Giuliani. On the other side are people like Ambassador William Taylor (a decorated Vietnam veteran who was picked by Mike Pompeo), former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch (the anti-corruption hero and daughter of refugees from the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany), and George Kent (a respected diplomat). I know who I would and wouldn’t want checking in on my wife and kids. To Trump’s apologists, though, these are the unelected bureaucrats who are orchestrating a “coup.” In my opinion, when everyone honorable—even the people your own secretary of state handpicks—thinks you’re the one who is wrong, perhaps you’re the one with the problem. Maybe that’s just me. Still, the contrast between the white hats and the black hats is stark. And it is likely to continue this week, when (among the eight men and women slated to testify) Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a Jewish refugee who fled the Soviet Union and went on to be awarded a Purple Heart, will take center stage. In general, the people testifying against Trump have lived lives of honor and integrity and service. Many are from families who fled persecution. Many have sacrificed for their country. Compared to the Republican politicians and commentators denigrating them, these are saints. The question isn’t just about decency. If we were trying to discern who the real “conservatives” are, I’m pretty sure Trump, Rush, and Rudy are at like nine or 10 marriages among them. But Trumpers have another “ball and chain” to worry about. By my count, the following Trump associates and friends have (so far) been convicted: Paul Manafort (Trump’s campaign manager), Michael Cohen (Trump’s lawyer and “fixer”), Rick Gates (former Trump aide), Michael Flynn (Trump’s national security adviser), George Papadopoulos (Trump campaign adviser), and Roger Stone (Trump’s long-time friend and adviser).Another question to ponder: How many of your friends and close business associates have been convicted? I would suggest that Trump’s association with so many disreputable people is no accident. There are no lack of clichés. Show me your friends and I’ll show you your future. Birds of a feather flock together. Like the “Axis of Evil” opening scene in The Naked Gun, the bad guys always seem to find each other. We are, after all, talking about a president who likes dictators better than democratically elected world leaders, and who just pardoned two service members accused of war crimes and restored the rank of another. Whether you’re a conservative or even just a decent, patriotic American, you have more to admire in the people testifying in the impeachment hearings than in the people defending the president. Of course, this week may test that theory. The key witness looks to be EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland—a man who gained his ambassadorship by donating a million smackers to Trump’s inaugural committee and who has already had to revise his testimony. Unlike last week’s witnesses, Sondland has dedicated his life to building wealth, not public service (not that there’s anything wrong with that). More to the point, unlike last week’s witnesses, Sondland (allegedly) has firsthand evidence that Trump ordered the shakedown of Ukraine. It’s unclear whether he will deliver the coup de grace, but one thing is certain: Sondland wasn’t so forthcoming about Trump before the “career bureaucrats” forced him to revise his testimony (or risk perjury). You don’t have to squint too hard to see who the real American heroes are.

Don't get any of us started on calling Trump the ""people's president,"" or the notion that the speaker of the House is ""betraying her oath of office"" for allowing an investigation of apparent administration crimes as outlined in the aforementioned Actual Constitution. It is shamelessly asinine, there's that ""overthrow"" language again, and, long story short, Brad Parscale has managed a propaganda-per-word ratio that puts even the Devin Nuneses of the party to shame. But Parscale's burps here are the actual Republican strategy, and stem from longstanding Republican rhetoric. Attempting to hold lawbreaking Republican officials to account is a ""seditious conspiracy""; utilizing any of the powers specifically designated to lawmakers by the Constitution is illegitimate and a ""betrayal"" if done by a Democrat. In the Parscale framework, the mere presence of a non-Republican opposition is itself illegitimate. Opposing Republicanism amounts to betraying the nation itself; the two are seen as synonymous. This theory, which has been pushed heavily by Fox News over the years, is intended to convey to the public that anyone attempting to rein in conservative whims (much less crimes) is a direct danger to the republic. And this has continued to result in domestic terrorism aimed at the targets of the day, from Glenn Beck's bizarre claims against the Tides Foundation to the Trump van would-be mail bomber targeting an extensive list of the people Brad Parscale and his hires call out as enemies. We can see this again in the other conservative propaganda story of the day, the production of a truly weird and ultraviolent depiction of Donald Trump, glorious movement leader, systemically murdering a laundry list of named political enemies. The video was screened at a pricey conservative shindig at Trump's Doral resort, with top conservatives in attendance; it was not merely the usual scrapings of the neo-Nazi corners of the internet. Or rather, it was—but brought to top-level movement prominence as an appropriate depiction for that time and place. The elements of the video are explicitly fascist. There is Dear Leader, depicted as larger than life, a fit and overpowering action hero capable of single-handedly committing great martial acts. There is the explicit celebration of violence—of sweeping, politically orchestrated murder—as tool for furthering the movement. There is the depiction of the free press and opposing political voices as not mere adversaries, but enemies to be dispensed with. Public objections are dismissed as the impotent scolding of prudes; the clip is merely intended as a humorous diversion for the assembled dignitaries. That the named targets are speaking out against it is just further evidence of their own animosities. This is the environment in which Brad Parscale bleats out new declarations that the House speaker is betraying her office and nation, and that investigating Dear Leader for a self-evidently criminal act that Dear Leader himself provided evidence of is now seditious and a conspiracy. It is intended to delegitimize those that oppose the ""movement"" not as wrongheaded, but as enemies of the state. It is intended to push true believers closer to the edge, as Dear Leader's allies openly muse about the possibility of civil war if Dear Leader is held to account. It is not Trump, but the party. The whole of the Republican Party has been playing this extravagantly dangerous game, squeezed up from militia groups and white nationalist fever dreams to be promoted by Fox News talking heads as a means of defending conservative allies from the usual rigors of oversight. You can say the word fascist; Parscale and the others have wrapped themselves in many of its most dramatic particulars. Whether that is tactical plan or mere bumbling coincidence is at this point irrelevant.

",,ME-Sen: New PPP Poll Shows Impeachment Already Hurting Susan Collins' (R) Re-Election Bid,"Here’s the latest news out of Maine courtesy of PPP’s latest poll: PPP’s newest Maine poll finds that Susan Collins is in trouble for reelection…and that she’s likely to find herself in more trouble no matter what side of impeachment she comes down on. Collins is unpopular, with only 35% of voters approving of the job she’s doing to 50% who disapprove. She trails a generic Democrat for reelection 44-41. That represents a big drop for Collins compared to a poll we did last September when she led a generic Democrat by 6 points at 44-38. At that time she only trailed 64-21 among Clinton voters but in the wake of her vote on Brett Kavanaugh and the general hardening of partisan lines she’s lost a lot of her crossover support and now trails 76-12 with Clinton voters. 53% of Mainers support impeaching Donald Trump with 44% opposed. When we ask voters who they would choose if Collins opposed impeachment, her 76-12 deficit among Clinton voters grows even further to 83-8 and she goes from a 3 point deficit against a generic Democratic opponent for reelection to a 7 point deficit at 47-40. Collins faces defeat from a different angle if she supports impeachment though. Her numbers are already a little bit soft with Republican primary voters with 53% saying they generally support her for the nomination again to 38% who say they would prefer someone else. We also tested Collins against some specific possible opponents in a primary- she trails Paul LePage 63-29 and Shawn Moody 45-36 but does lead Derek Levasseur who already entered and exited the race this year 55-10. Things get a lot worse for Collins within the primary electorate if she supports impeachment though. Trump still has an 80% approval rating with GOP voters in the state- much higher than Collins’ 59% approval- and only 14% of primary voters support impeachment to 83% who are opposed to it. When we ask voters about the Republican primary if Collins supports impeachment there’s a 35 point net shift from supporting Collins by 15 points at 53/38 to opposing Collins by 20 points, with just 35% still wanting to nominate Collins if she supports impeachment to 55% who prefer someone else. There’s also a 32 point shift in a hypothetical match with Levasseur from her 45 point initial advantage at 55-10 to just a 13 point advantage at 37-24. And presumably supporting impeaching Trump might bring a more serious primary challenger than Levasseur out of the woodwork. Collins has been remarkably resilient over the years but the issue of impeachment seems to have the potential to cause her to lose in the general election if she chooses one path and to lose in the primary election if she chooses the other path, leaving her with no good options. And Collins’ top opponent has been raising serious cash: Let’s keep up the moment and win a Democratic Senate Majority. Click here to donate and get involved with Sara Gideon’s (D. ME) campaign.

Only a Revolution..as distasteful as it sounds, on it’s face, maybe the only way to save our Country|satire|",1,.Pelosi and the Democrats think all the US money is theirs|||,,Pelosi Didn’t Raid Social Security for Impeachment Inquiry,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not taken money away from Social Security in order to fund the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. That hoax is the product of America’s Last Line of Defense, a self-described “satirical” publication whose viral headlines across a network of websites often deceive social media users. Its story was published Oct. 4 on one its websites, potatriotsunite.com, with the headline, “Pelosi Diverts $2.4 Billion From Social Security To Cover Impeachment Costs.” Observant users who clicked through to the full story might have noticed the many tags littered throughout the page indicating its fictitious nature: A banner at the top of the website, for example, reads, “Potatriots unite for satire, ridicule and mockery.” But it appears many did not. More than two dozen people emailed FactCheck.org inquiring about whether the claim was true, and the story has been shared more than 100,000 times on Facebook, according to CrowdTangle data. The bogus story appeared in political Facebook groups supportive of Trump — such as “The Common Thread (C) – Trump – Pence 2020,” “People who support President Trump,” and “Deplorables for Trump” — where it was often met by outrage. One user opined: “This is nothing new..Pelosi and the Democrats think all the US money is theirs..to do whatever they want to at any whim. Only a Revolution..as distasteful as it sounds, on it’s face, maybe the only way to save our Country…The Politicians can’t or won’t do it….It’s coming…fasten your seatbelt.” Another wrote: “ENOUGH!!!!!!! NO ONE IS SUPPOSED TO TOUCH THAT MONEY!!!! THAT’S ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO PAID INTO IT EVERY PAYCHECK SINCE DAY ONE! AND THEIR EMPLOYERS MATCHED THE AMOUNT WE PAID INTO IT! IT’S OUR SAVINGS ACCOUNT FOR RETIREMENT!!! WHO Authorized that!!!!!???????” It’s worth noting that Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system, meaning that current Social Security tax revenues are used to pay the cost of current benefits, as explained in a 2019 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Surplus revenues can be used for other government expenses, but Social Security has run cash-flow deficits every year since 2010, CRS says, so there isn’t any surplus revenues that can be used for other government expenses. That rules out the possibility that Social Security funds can be used to cover the cost of an impeachment inquiry. And Social Security benefit payments are considered “mandatory spending” and are not subject to the annual appropriations process. We do not know how much the impeachment inquiry proceedings against Trump will ultimately cost. The Associated Press, citing records at the time, reported in 1999 that the five-month impeachment proceedings against former President Bill Clinton cost about $1.2 million — or nearly $1.9 million in today’s dollars, when adjusted for inflation.",VC,,9,,1,"That hoax is the product of America’s Last Line of Defense, a self-described “satirical” publication whose viral headlines across a network of websites often deceive social media users.|The bogus story appeared in political Facebook groups supportive of Trump — such as “The Common Thread (C) – Trump – Pence 2020,” “People who support President Trump,” and “Deplorables for Trump” — where it was often met by outrage.|“This is nothing new..Pelosi and the Democrats think all the US money is theirs..to do whatever they want to at any whim.

But while his actual goal seems a bit elusive, he is increasingly playing a very specific role: the human straw man, the embodiment of every seemingly irrational conservative fear about what the left really wants. Consider O’Rourke’s appearance at Thursday’s CNN town hall on LGBTQ issues, at which he told moderator Don Lemon that churches and other nonprofits should lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage, a position tantamount to declaring war on Catholic parishes and evangelical congregations across the country, not to mention any number of Orthodox Jewish and Muslim groups. Lest you think I’m exaggerating, or leaving out some important nuance, here was his full exchange: Don Lemon: Do you think religious institutions like colleges, churches, charities—should they lose their tax-exempt status if they oppose same-sex marriage? Beto O’Rourke: Yes. There can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break, for anyone, any institution, any organization in America, that denies the full human rights, that denies the full civil rights, of everyone in America. So as president, we’re going to make that a priority. And we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans. O’Rourke’s comments drew a warm round of applause in the friendly room, and riled conservatives, who have spent years worrying that Democrats might try to do such a thing. Vlogger Ben Shapiro, to take just one example, suggested that religious conservatives might be forced to move out of the country or “pick up a gun” if the candidate’s plan ever comes to pass. Some on the left were also critical: Atlantic writer Adam Serwer called the idea “plainly unconstitutional.” This is not the first time O’Rourke—a politician, it should be noted, without a constituency: no district, almost no support in the polls—has promised to make conservatives’ worst nightmares come true. After adopting gun control as a marquee issue following the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, earlier this year, O’Rourke promised a mandatory gun buyback program for assault weapons, memorably telling a moderator, “Hell yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.” Not long after, Trump and Republicans blamed his comments for making it harder to get a gun control deal done in Congress. (Yes, that’s a bit rich coming from the GOP, but I’ll come back to that). These are not the only far-left positions Beto has staked out recently. He’s strongly pro-reparations, for instance. But his comments about churches and guns are especially remarkable, in that he’s essentially adopting unpopular stances that Democratic politicians have spent years claiming are unfair caricatures of their actual beliefs. He is turning himself into a walking straw man, the non-fringe guy Republicans can reliably point to when they want to say, “See, the libs really do want to take your guns and shut down your churches.” Religious conservatives have worried about the possibility that same-sex marriage could be used as an excuse to strip churches of their tax exemptions for several years now. The fear is rooted in a bit of history: In 1983, the Supreme Court ruled that the IRS could revoke Bob Jones University’s nonprofit status over its opposition to interracial dating and marriage. During oral arguments in Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that legalized same-sex marriage nationally, Justice Samuel Alito grilled Donald Verrilli, solicitor general under President Barack Obama, about whether creating a constitutional right to gay marriage could similarly lead to conservative churches and religious colleges losing their tax-free statuses. Verrilli said he wasn’t sure, adding that “it’s certainly going to be an issue. I don’t deny that, Justice Alito. It is going to be an issue.” This set off a wave of panic among religious conservative groups, which led Obama’s IRS commissioner to publicly announce that, no, the government would not try to nix anyone’s tax exemptions over positions on marriage. Now, O’Rourke has thrown kerosene on the issue all over again, and for what? For many religious institutions, this is a legitimately existential issue—paying property taxes, business income taxes (assuming they do more than break even), and losing the ability to collect tax-deductible donations would be a massive financial blow. For LGBTQ rights activists, it would perhaps be a moral victory, but one that would also risk triggering an explosive culture war over faith that could transform gay marriage back into a deeply polarizing topic when it’s been trending in the other direction. Meanwhile, I’ve seen no evidence that O’Rourke’s position has much support among a wide swath of Democratic voters or leaders. Yet there is now video of a telegenic presidential candidate bringing form to religious conservatives’ worst fears, like some sort of tax-policy Babadook. As for guns: It barely needs mentioning that the National Rifle Association’s entire fundraising and political strategy at this point consists of trying to convince its members that Democrats are coming to steal and melt down their rifles. The typical response from Democrats has been to say that, no, they just want some sensible regulations that will prevent needless deaths. As Hillary Clinton put it at the party’s national convention: “I’m not here to repeal the Second Amendment. I’m not here to take away your guns.” While this has not led to any political breakthroughs, it has been effective at shaping public opinion: Gun control measures like background checks and limits on assault rifles are extremely popular. Mandatory gun buybacks, on the other hand, are not. Of course, the most ardent gun control opponents have always assumed that Democrats are lying about all this and are secretly plotting mass gun confiscation. Some point back to a 1995 video in which Sen. Dianne Feinstein said that, if she could have rounded up 51 votes to ban all assault rifles, she would have. (They also badly misconstrue that moment as her saying she wanted to ban all guns). But I humbly submit that having a fresh video of Beto O’Rourke saying “hell yeah” refreshes their message a bit. The thing about all of this is that, politically, it is deeply unhelpful. I would personally argue that stripping churches of their tax-exempt status is a horrible idea on the merits for a long list of reasons it would take a whole second article to spell out. (Short version: Racial segregation has a unique and monstrous history in the U.S. that has required the government to take active measures to stamp out, à la Bob Jones, but generally speaking, the government absolutely should not be in the business of siding with one religious belief system over another, something that would create a troubling precedent a conservative administration might turn against other minorities, such as Muslims, one day.) I would, however, be perfectly comfortable with a mandatory buyback program. But neither is going to happen any time in the foreseeable future, and if anything, talking about them makes it harder to make actual progress on issues of gay rights and guns by activating conservatives’ fears about slippery slopes. Do I think that O’Rourke’s comments about AR-15s single-handedly made a gun deal that much harder in Congress, as some GOP senators have claimed? No—and for what it’s worth, Trump has lately been using impeachment as a reason to avoid negotiations. But do I think his mouthing off took a bit of the heat off Republicans by giving them an excuse not to engage? That, by making himself a convenient figure on which Republicans can hang bad-faith attacks about Democrats’ intentions, he has hurt the causes he’s supposed to be fighting for? Yes, I do. That’s what straw men are good for, after all. Update, Oct. 12, 2019, at 7:55 a.m.: The O’Rourke campaign’s rapid response director, Lauren Hitt, has sent me a statement attempting to clarify the candidate’s comments from Thursday: “There’s been a lot of confusion about Beto’s position on tax exempt status for religious institutions. In short, he would support revoking the tax exempt status for a religious institution that fired an employee or refused to hire someone b/c they were in a same-sex marriage. He would not, however, revoke tax-exempt status for a religious organization he simply disagree with.” This would still be a somewhat controversial position that would open up questions about the rights of churches. But if O’Rourke really was only talking about specific instances of employment discrimination, perhaps it would have been smart to say so onstage. ",VC,,,,,,,

Without a concerted voter suppression effort from then-Secretary of State and now-Governor Brian Kemp, she might have made it. That voter suppression started in 2017, when Kemp's office purged 534,199 voters from the rolls, the largest single voter purge ever. Since that worked, Georgia Republicans are going to do it again. This round targets about 330,000 registered voters who haven't participated in elections in the past few years, though this time around, the state will have to notify them that it's happening. The state is going to send notifications beginning in the next few weeks to the last known address of the inactive voters, giving them 30 days to respond. Voters can either use a provided postage-paid registration form to keep their registration active, or reregister online, mail a form, or vote on Nov. 5. The state will remove the names of those who don't respond in December. Luckily, Abrams and Fair Fight Action, the group she founded to fight voter suppression, are on the case. ""Voters should not lose their right to vote simply because they have decided not to express that right in recent elections,"" said Lauren Groh-Wargo, the CEO of Fair Fight Action. ""Having a long history of voter suppression, the Georgia secretary of state's office has a responsibility to guarantee that not a single voter is wrongly included on the purge list."" The organization is already suing the state over ""voter registration cancellations, precinct closures, long lines, malfunctioning voting equipment and disqualified ballots"" that disproportionately penalized people of color in the 2018 election. The suit alleges that the balloting ""was so flawed that it prevented thousands of voters from being counted, especially African Americans."" ""There were a lot of people showing up on Election Day and not finding themselves on the rolls and not understanding why,"" Myrna Pérez, the director of the Voting Rights and Elections Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said. ""When mistakes are made, we feel it on Election Day. That's the last place you want to feel it.""

That sets up yet another budget fight that will simmer along between the House, Senate, and White House for the next month. It also sets up another fight over a Trump government shutdown. Before the August recess, all parties agreed to a continuing resolution to fund the government until the week before Thanksgiving, in anticipation that all the individual spending bills for all the departments would be passed and signed by then. What it really set up was another fight with Trump. ""Trump is not interested in signing other domestic spending bills until there is agreement on the border wall,"" a senior administration official told The Washington Post. The last disastrous government shutdown was limited in scope, affecting just a few departments but tens of thousands of people. The next one would be much bigger, because it would affect the entire government.

Ten Republicans voted with Democrats to override Trump's veto, including Roy Blunt of Missouri, who is not known for his opposition to Trump on anything. Those 10 votes pose a challenge to McConnell on backing up Trump's hard line on the border wall. It is also most definitely not a fight the most vulnerable members of his conference in 2020 will want to take on.

No strategy.’: Kamala Harris campaign in meltdown,"BALTIMORE — Kamala Harris’ campaign is careening toward a crackup. As the California senator crisscrosses the country trying to revive her sputtering presidential bid, aides at her fast-shrinking headquarters are deep into the finger-pointing stages. And much of the blame is being placed on campaign manager Juan Rodriguez. After Rodriguez announced dozens of layoffs and re-deployments in late October to stem overspending, three more staffers at headquarters here were let go and another quit in recent days, aides told POLITICO. Officials said they’ve become increasingly frustrated at the campaign chief’s lack of clarity about what changes have been made to right the ship and his plans to turn the situation around. They hold Rodriguez responsible for questionable budget decisions, including continuing to bring on new hires shortly before the layoffs began. Amid the turmoil, some aides have gone directly to campaign chair Maya Harris, the candidate’s sister, and argued that Rodriguez needs to be replaced if Harris has any hope of a turnaround, according to two officials. “It’s a campaign of id,” said one senior Harris official, laying much of the blame on Rodriguez, but also pointing to a leaderless structure at the top that’s been allowed to flail without accountability. “What feels right, what impulse you have right now, what emotion, what frustration,” the official added. The person described the current state of the campaign in blunt terms: “No discipline. No plan. No strategy.” This account is based on interviews with more than a dozen current and former staffers as well as others close to the campaign, including donors. The sources were granted anonymity to speak freely about the turmoil within the organization and protect them from repercussions. The internal strife is the latest discouraging development for Harris’ once-encouraging candidacy. She has slid into low single digits and is now banking on a top-tier performance in Iowa to pull her back into contention. Inside the campaign, which had already experienced staff shakeups before the layoffs, rank and file aides are fed up with the weak leadership and uncertainty around internal communication, planning and executing on a clear vision. They say the constant shifting has eroded trust in the upper ranks. While staff ire centers on Rodriguez, his defenders argue he has stood loyally by the candidate despite being relegated to a role akin to deputy campaign manager to Maya Harris. They say he’s had to get Maya Harris’ buy-in even on routine decisions, which were often slow to materialize, further undermining staff’s confidence in him as a supervisor. “From the outset of this race, he has had all the responsibility with none of the authority. He’s been managing this race with at least one, if not two, hands tied behind his back,” a senior campaign official and longtime Harris hand said of the Rodriguez-Maya Harris dynamic. Rodriguez’s decision to keep mum amid criticism from staff is evidence of his devotion to the candidate, his defenders said. “He would never talk shit about [Maya]. He would never undermine her. He’s just not that guy,” the senior official said. Aides describe a bleak environment in which workers have started to openly question the judgment of managers after seeing colleagues marched out the door. During a recent meeting, aides pressed Rodriguez and Maya Harris for answers about campaign strategy. At one point during the more than two-hour discussion, Maya Harris herself turned to Rodriguez and challenged him in front of about 20 staffers, and several more listening in by phone. Rodriguez seemed unprepared for the exchange, according to people present. They walked out with little consensus about how to prioritize upcoming events and strategy around advertising. One recently departed aide tried to sum up the mess: At the staff level, the person said, “everybody has had to consolidate. Everybody has had to make cuts. And people are pissed. They see a void. They want to push someone out. And I understand that. But the root cause of all of this is that no one was empowered really to make the decisions and make them fast and make them decisively.” Still, others point to Rodriguez’s constant yielding to Maya Harris as a reason he should be held accountable for the campaign's failures. “It was his decision,” another aide said of the fraying pact, adding there were opportunities for him to take control. “He chose to defer to Maya.” The unorthodox composition of the campaign is further complicated by other factors. Rodriguez’s California business partners — Ace Smith, Sean Clegg and Laphonza Butler — are senior Harris advisers atop a flat leadership structure that includes just a few other outside voices, including ad maker Jim Margolis, pollster David Binder and Maya Harris. Critics of the arrangement say it has contributed to an insular culture and reinforced the business partners’ long-term obligations to one another. The leadership upheaval is the latest turn in a campaign that has endured multiple reorganizations and never gelled as a unit. In September, Rodriguez announced internally that he was putting Butler and Rohini Kosoglu, Harris’ former Senate chief of staff, in charge of most departments. The moves soon gave way to other changes. Under an updated iteration, Clegg formally assumed control of messaging while Butler took over the financial, digital and operations teams. Dave Huynh, the campaign’s delegate expert, was put in charge of the political department. Emmy Ruiz’s turf included states and the field organization. And Kosoglu oversaw scheduling, communications, advance and policy. Yet, even these seemingly clearer lines of authority are already being blurred. In late October, Rodriguez informed staff that he was redeploying aides to Iowa from other states and laying off dozens of others, including at the campaign’s headquarters. He said at the time that the moves were driven by the need to stash enough money for a seven-figure TV ad buy in the weeks before the Iowa caucuses. Now, it’s unclear whether Harris will have the money to do so. The former aide said people in the campaign began warning of declining revenues early, but that leadership dysfunction around Rodriguez, Maya Harris and others convinced the person that Harris wasn’t getting an unvarnished view of the picture. “I don’t think anybody wanted to tell her,” the former aide said, adding, “I still don’t think she knows the severity.” Other aides express fears that the candidate is not being advised of the gravity of the organizational troubles. And they question the wisdom of firing junior and midlevel staffers while the main people empowered to make decisions have all been spared. Harris’ history with Rodriguez began six years ago, when Rodriguez, who had been an aide to Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, took a job in the California attorney general’s office as a conduit to the city of Los Angeles. Late in 2015, Rodriguez, then a senior adviser to Harris’ Senate campaign, came out of the bullpen to manage her race after she parted ways with her first manager. It wasn’t a competitive contest, but Rodriguez helped oversee spending cuts and staff and consultant layoffs as he worked to significantly slash Harris’ overhead. Maya Harris had helped bring in the first round of hires for that campaign, including several people who were eventually fired, before leaving to run policy for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign. When the Harris sisters were building the 2020 staff, they and others were in talks with at least one well-known Democratic strategist whose understanding of the proposed role at the time was to serve alongside Rodriguez given his lack of national campaign experience. The consultant passed, and no one else emerged in that capacity. Rodriguez confidants from the campaign said they urged him to quit long ago given the challenging nature of the family dynamic, but they don’t think he will. “It was like, ‘I need to be the captain of the Titanic and go down with this ship,’” one said after talking to him recently. In a statement to POLITICO, Rodriguez said, “Campaigns are long and arduous, but we are all united in our commitment to making sure Kamala is the nominee to take on Donald Trump and win.” “We have had to make tough decisions to compete in Iowa and ensure Kamala is in a position to be the Democratic nominee, but Maya, I, and the rest of the amazing team are pouring our heart and soul into winning this campaign.” Aides pointed to late efforts to save the organization. They were invited by management into a crowd-sourcing push for ideas they hope will be incorporated into the plan going forward. The organizational problems have been agonizing for rank-and-file workers who still believe in Harris’ chances and want to do right by her, another aide said. But the person noted that Harris’ well-received speech at a major Democratic event in Iowa a few weeks ago was eclipsed by news of layoffs across New Hampshire earlier that day. It was the latest reminder, the aide said, of her diminished standing in the race and the dysfunction in Baltimore. “The loyalty and love for Kamala Harris has never waned,” the person said. “People are still very much invested in her. It’s the directionlessness of the campaign that frustrates them.” There’s more than enough blame to go around at the top, the aide concluded. “The whole campaign has been a bunch of people sitting around a table giving opinions and then not backing them up when it comes down to it,” the person said. “The apparatus wasted her talent more than she blew it.”",CR,,0,||,1,"“It’s a campaign of id,” said one senior Harris official, laying much of the blame on Rodriguez, but also pointing to a leaderless structure at the top that’s been allowed to flail without accountability.||",0,||

Col. Alexander Vindman, the decorated Army combat veteran who was slated to give testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, I tweeted this: I'm not a soothsayer so I was only half-serious, but sure enough within the hour this was on Fox News: This line was clearly an official talking point since the next day similar language appeared again on Fox and on CNN: Rudy Giuliani got in on the act as well: Needless to say, this created a major controversy. Top Republicans, including Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, all stepped forward to denounce these comments and declare Vindman a patriot. John Yoo even offered a mealy-mouthed ""explanation"" for his earlier comments on Facebook.But let's not kid ourselves. The networks replayed those despicable smears dozens of times all day long as they reported the ""backlash."" As a political operative once said to me years ago when I gloated about a Republican flack having to ""walk back"" a statement she'd made earlier in the day: ""She got it out there, didn't she?"" Among the punditocracy, it is an article of faith that Republicans are flag-waving guardians of the military, so many people expressed surprise that such a thing would have come from Fox News since, as the Washington Post's Eric Wemple wrote, ""no network celebrates the troops as aggressively as Fox News."" NeverTrump Republicans, meanwhile, bemoaned the sad fate of their once patriotic party under Donald Trump:John Weaver, who worked for John McCain: Given this general consensus among the political class that this was a highly unusual attack on a decorated military man by the devoted patriots of the right, why did I immediately assume they would smear him? Well, because there's nothing at all unusual about it. Sure, conservatives love to wave the flag and claim the that they're the only true Americans, but history shows that their great love for the troops is as shallow as their respect for the Constitution. Consider the most infamous Republican senator of the last century, Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, and his anti-communist crusade. People may not remember that McCarthy's most important target was none other than Gen. George Marshall, who was considered to be suspect by right-wingers because he ""associated with traitors"" when he developed the plan to rebuild Europe. As President Harry Truman's secretary of state and then secretary of defense, Marshall came under relentless attack by McCarthy and his accomplices. McCarthy once took to the Senate floor to deliver a 60,000-word diatribe accusing the decorated American hero of ""a conspiracy on a scale so immense as to dwarf any previous such venture in the history of man."" One might have thought that Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican presidential candidate in 1952 — the year of that attack — would have stepped up to defend his fellow soldier. But it wasn't politically expedient. As the PBS series American Experience described it:Eisenhower's personal and political instincts came into conflict during a campaign stop in McCarthy's home state of Wisconsin. Eisenhower was prepared to deliver a defense of Marshall, praising him ""as a man and a soldier,"" and condemning the tactics of McCarthy as a ""sobering lesson in the way freedom must not defend itself."" But noble intentions gave way to political reality. Aware of McCarthy's huge base of support and not willing to risk losing votes in a crucial state, Eisenhower delivered his speech minus the defense of Marshall and the condemnation of McCarthy. Those were the good old days when Republicans were virtuous and put the country first. After attempting to destroy one of World War II's most distinguished generals, the Republicans homed in on another political rival with a heroic war record, Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts. Kennedy came from a famous family, of course, but his personal reputation was made during his naval career as the commander of a PT boat in the South Pacific that came under heavy enemy fire. Republicans started a whisper campaign suggesting that Kennedy would have been court-martialed for cowardice had he not been wealthy and well-connected, and those rumors dogged JFK throughout the 1960 presidential campaign. That wasn't the last time Republicans trashed the reputation of a decorated veteran who happened to be a political opponent. Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota was denigrated as a coward and a Communist sympathizer when he ran for president in 1972 — and he had been an Air Force pilot who flew 35 bombing missions over Germany and Nazi-occupied Europe, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal. For more recent examples, we only have to look to the last decade when the GOP turned its smear machine onto Sen. Max Cleland of Georgia, who had lost both legs and one arm in Vietnam, winning both the Silver Star and Bronze Star for valor in combat. During the 2002 midterm elections, with the country reeling from 9/11 and the Republican Party riding high, Cleland's Republican challenger, Saxby Chambliss, ran a scurrilous ad associating Cleland with Osama bin Laden and saying he lacked ""courage."" The only prominent Republican who spoke out against that was Sen. John McCain, who said ""I’ve never seen anything like that ad. It’s worse than disgraceful, it’s reprehensible."" Cleland lost that race. Chambliss refused to apologize, even years later. That brings us to the most famous example of Republicans trashing a war hero in recent history: the ""swiftboating"" of Sen. John Kerry during the 2004 presidential campaign. This was a highly sophisticated smear campaign, designed and implemented by conservative operatives and political strategists. Kerry was a Vietnam veteran running against George W. Bush, who had obtained a coveted spot in the Texas National Guard and never served overseas (while rarely showing up for duty), so Republicans set out to destroy Kerry's war record with lies. They even mocked his Purple Heart by passing out Band-aids at the Republican convention, a juvenile stunt that sowed the seeds of Donald Trump's denigration of a Republican Vietnam War hero, John McCain. A couple of days ago I wrote about the Republican strategy to discredit the impeachment inquiry the same way they discredited the Mueller report. In their view that strategy was very successful since the report was seen as something of a dud, showing ""no collusion, no obstruction"" — although it showed that Trump had welcomed Russian help and obstructed justice at least 10 times. In order to pull that off again, Trump's boosters need to turn all the witnesses into liars and traitors and ensure that their base believes the entire impeachment process is a ""witch hunt.""

Shortly after the impeachment inquiry was announced, the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, told reporters that yes, the Trump administration “held up the money” for aid to Ukraine in a quid pro quo deal for an investigation into the Biden family, and that everybody should just “get over it.” Since then, the White House has done what it does most of the time: scramble to spin, spin, spin. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, whose work history has more red flags than an Olympic slalom event, has never held a single press conference, but she has found the time to speak with Fox News hosts on occasion. CNN’s Anderson Cooper took Grisham to task on his show on Friday during a segment called “The RidicuList.” Cooper pointed out that Grisham has not held a single official news briefing and then went on to discuss Grisham’s strange appearance defending Mick Mulvaney’s statement. As with all Trump mouthpieces, Grisham went to Fox & Friends and blamed the evil media, saying it had gotten itself “in a tizzy” over nothing. In a clip that can be seen below, Cooper mocked Grisham and asked the audience whether everybody who worked for Trump “had to debase themselves and lie like he does.” He hooked on to a certain talking point that Grisham has echoed a few times on Fox News—that press conferences and media availabilities with White House officials are “theater.” The talking point is a perfect one for the Trump administration, as it’s dismissive of the media while absolving White House officials of lying. She also said that press conferences were “about people wanting to be on TV and making names for themselves.” Anderson joked that Grisham needs to expand her vocabulary, and clearly didn’t get to Broadway enough, as her ideas of what theater is are rather narrow. He said, “Maybe one of these seven days a week she’s not doing her job, she can catch maybe a matinee of Hamilton. Just tell them Mike Pence sent you—you’ll probably get free tickets. Also, I hate to break it to you, but TV reporters are already on TV.” Cooper pointed out that the few times Trump has spoken to a collection of media in any official news conference, he has done things like display Trump steaks and cover the stage with every available American flag. Business Insider reports that it received a response from Stephanie Grisham herself! In response to the CNN clip, Grisham said, “I think CNN has lost sight of the fact that we are human beings. Just as Anderson Cooper has a job to do, working for a company he is proud of, so do I. I also imagine he has a personal life, where he has to juggle quite a bit – and the same goes for me.” Grisham realized she needed to really drive home what it is she is trying to do, “I am a single mom who (proudly) holds three roles in the White House, and I am doing the very best I can. But I definitely don’t get to Broadway enough.” You see that, media elites! She’s a hard-working single mother. Surprisingly, her children haven’t been taken away and stuck in cages, and shockingly, Marco Rubio and Ivanka Trump’s attempts to privatize paid family leave haven’t helped ease Grisham’s burden. Trump’s press team has a long history of supporting, promoting, and defending inhumane policies and positions. They are willing to smear anyone, including grieving parents, in order to prove fealty to their pathological liar in chief. And while Stephanie Grisham is right—she and her White House colleagues are human—they aren’t doing a very good job of being human.",CR,,1,"White House press secretary whines after CNN’s Anderson Cooper ridiculed her outrageous lies|In a clip that can be seen below, Cooper mocked Grisham and asked the audience whether everybody who worked for Trump “had to debase themselves and lie like he does.” |",1,"White House press secretary whines after CNN’s Anderson Cooper ridiculed her outrageous lies|Donald Trump promised to bring the best and brightest with him to the White House, but instead has delivered a long line of upward-failing orcs. |As with all Trump mouthpieces, Grisham went to Fox & Friends and blamed the evil media, saying it had gotten itself “in a tizzy” over nothing.",1,"As with all Trump mouthpieces, Grisham went to Fox & Friends and blamed the evil media, saying it had gotten itself “in a tizzy” over nothing.|In a clip that can be seen below, Cooper mocked Grisham and asked the audience whether everybody who worked for Trump “had to debase themselves and lie like he does.”|"

While it’s pretty unlikely enough Republican senators will actually vote to convict President Donald Trump if articles of impeachment are brought against him, members who represent swing states, such as Susan Collins, might feel pressure to defect due to pushback from their constituents. Others, like Mitt Romney, have vocalized opposition to the president in the past and are among the most likely to do so again. As Vanity Fair’s Gabriel Sherman writes, it’s possible that a definitive statement from a lawmaker like Romney could be the “pressure point” to embolden other Republicans to confront Trump on impeachment. Thus far, the Senate Republican response to a July phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been mixed. According to a Washington Post analysis, roughly 15 Republican lawmakers have expressed concerns or pushed for more information about Trump’s call asking Zelensky for help investigating Hunter Biden, the son of his 2020 rival Joe Biden. Several Republicans have also spoken out in response to Trump pressuring the Chinese government to investigate Hunter Biden, comments the president made publicly to the press. The other 38 Republicans, meanwhile, have sought to undercut the whistleblower’s credibility and thrown their backing behind the president. No Republican senators have gone so far as to express support for the impeachment inquiry. In order for the Senate to convict the president of charges, 20 Senate Republicans would have to join with the 47-member Democratic caucus in order to reach the 67-person supermajority threshold that’s needed. Still, any breaks within the Republican conference don’t look great for Trump and help give Democrats further ammunition to use against him in the 2020 election. Trump himself is counting on Republican senators’ support, reportedly calling Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at frequent intervals to stress the need for GOP unity. For now, the Republicans facing the most pressure — particularly those up for reelection in 2020 — are broadly saying they need more “facts” before they can take a conclusive stance on Trump’s calls for foreign help. Their responses offer a way to dodge questions about his behavior while maintaining some semblance of accountability. With new information coming out seemingly every day and with Congress in session once more, here are a slew of lawmakers we’re watching and what they’ve said on the subject so far: Mitt Romney (R-UT) Romney, an on-again, off-again, critic of the president, has offered some of the strongest rebukes of Trump’s comments about China and Ukraine: “When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China’s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated.” He’s declined to comment more directly on the impeachment inquiry, however: “I haven’t spoken with any other Republican senator about the impeachment process, either in person or by email or text. I haven’t discussed that with anybody.” (The Salt Lake Tribune) Susan Collins (R-ME) Collins is among the most vulnerable Republicans this cycle and will need to win over a hefty number of independents to hang onto her seat. She’s criticized Trump’s comments about China: “I thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent. It’s completely inappropriate.” (Bangor Daily News) But she’s declined to take a stand explicitly on the impeachment inquiry, citing her role as a potential juror: “If there are articles of impeachment I would be a juror just as I was in the trial for President Clinton, and as a juror I think it’s inappropriate for me to reach conclusions about evidence or to comment on the proceedings in the House.” (Bloomberg) Ben Sasse (R-NE) Sasse, a one-time Trump critic who’s since earned the president’s endorsement ahead of a reelection fight in 2020, has slammed the president’s comments about China: “Hold up: Americans don’t look to Chinese commies for the truth. If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that’s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps.” (Omaha World-Herald) When it comes to the impeachment inquiry, Sasse is focused on rounding up more information: “I’m glad the President agreed with the requests a number of us have been making that the administration release this unredacted transcript. The President should also provide all additional relevant materials to the Committee. At a time when foreign powers work every day to exploit our divisions, it’s important for public trust that Americans know what did and did not happen here. We need shared facts. As the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence fulfills its oversight responsibilities, this first release is the right choice for the country.” (Sasse press statement) Joni Ernst (R-IA) Ernst, a senator who’s fighting to keep her seat in a swing state, dodged questions about Trump’s Ukraine call during the recess: “I don’t know that we have that information in front of us.” (Associated Press) She’s argued, however, that the whistleblower should be shielded from potential retaliation: “Whistleblowers should be protected.” (The Washington Post) Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) Murkowski, a Republican who’s broken with Trump in the past on Kavanaugh and the Affordable Care Act, has pushed for more information about the allegations raised against Trump: “What I find equally troubling is that even before there has been any considered review, that people have decided. There is either ‘absolutely, you must get rid of him tomorrow’ viewpoint or ‘he must stay in and no questions asked.’” “I’m also trying to think to myself, if this set of facts were to be in front of me and the president was President Hillary Clinton as opposed to President Donald Trump, would I be viewing this in a different way? Because if I do, that’s wrong. I shouldn’t view whether what is right and what is wrong based on the political affiliation of the individual that we are considering.” (The Hill) A Murkowski spokesperson has previously said that the senator will work on informing herself while the House conducts its impeachment inquiry: “In terms of the formal impeachment inquiry —that lies in the House of Representatives. Right now the Senate doesn’t have a part in this until the House reviews and they act. Until the point the Senate has a role in this, Senator Murkowski will wait to see the process play out in the House. Separately, she’s doing all she can to make sure she’s informed on the current allegations and will review the full transcript from the phone call in question when it’s released.” (KTUU News) Martha McSally (R-AZ) While McSally was pretty critical of an impeachment inquiry when it was first announced, calling it a “distraction,” she’s since shifted her tone quite a bit. Facing a tough election in 2020, she recently refrained from taking a decisive position on the inquiry: “This a serious matter, like I’ve said, and I think we’ve seen some partisan dynamics going on. And I think as Americans, none of us should be throwing around the ‘I-word’ as if it’s a joke. “I think people want us to take a serious look at this and not have it be just partisan bickering going on.” (Talking Points Memo) “I am going to, when information is presented to me that’s been investigated by people who are not being partisan, we will share and be in our role going forward.” (Arizona Republic) Cory Gardner (R-CO) Gardner, a vulnerable senator who’s up for reelection in 2020, evaded questions over the recess about Trump’s requests for foreign government interference: “It’s an answer that you get from a very serious investigation.” (Associated Press) Meanwhile, Gardner has criticized the impeachment inquiry as a partisan effort: “I joined my Senate colleagues in unanimously supporting the release of the whistleblower report, and I support the Senate Intelligence Committee’s on-going bipartisan review to gather all of the facts. Nancy Pelosi’s impeachment inquiry to appease the far-left isn’t something the majority of Americans support and will sharply divide the country.” (CPR News) Lamar Alexander (R-TN) Alexander, a lawmaker who’s retiring from his seat, has called Trump’s conduct “inappropriate” but notes that he sees impeachment as a “mistake”: “It’s inappropriate for the president to be talking with foreign governments about investigating his political opponents, but impeachment would be a mistake. An election, which is just around the corner, is the right way to decide who should be president. Impeachment has never removed a president. It will only divide the country further.” (WREG News)",CR,,0,||,1,"Still, any breaks within the Republican conference don’t look great for Trump and help give Democrats further ammunition to use against him in the 2020 election.|“When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China’s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated.”|“I thought the president made a big mistake by asking China to get involved in investigating a political opponent.

Schiff had invited Nunes and fellow Republicans to submit a witness list ahead of public proceedings in the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump’s Ukraine dealings, which begin next week. The first open hearing will be held on Nov. 13, and House Resolution 660, which passed in late October, requires Schiff to ask his colleagues in the House minority to suggest witnesses with a justification for each request “which should be guided by the inquiry’s parameters.” The requests won’t necessarily all be honored, but the Democrat did promise to consult on the proposed witnesses and evaluate their relevance. The offer was, after all, intended to address Republicans’ complaints that Democrats are running secret proceedings without their involvement, and Schiff wants to seem reasonable and fair. Republican resistance Still, the complaints continue unabated. Nunes in his letter to Schiff today accused Democrats of fabricating sinister evidence against the president “out of thin air” and ignoring Trump’s due process rights while leaking cherry-picked information from a private investigation designed to mislead the public and damage the executive. He referred to the “impeachment inquiry” in quotes to emphasize Republicans’ view that the investigation is illegitimate and wrote, “Americans see through this sham impeachment process, despite Democrats’ retroactive attempt to legitimize it last week.” The Republican argued that traditional hearings allow the minority to call whatever witnesses they choose, without being subject to the majority’s approval. He decried the fact that there is no such automatic allowance in the upcoming proceedings. Nonetheless, Nunes wrote, “to provide transparency to your otherwise opaque and unfair process…Americans deserve to hear from the following witnesses in an open setting.” He provided a list of 10 witnesses, most notably including Hunter Biden, the son of former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, Trump’s political rival. Hunter was a board member of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Trump, in his own words, wanted Ukrainian authorities to investigate unproven allegations that Biden senior, in his capacity as an Obama administration official fighting corruption in Ukraine, attempted to redirect a corruption inquiry into the company because of his son’s involvement. The impeachment inquiry is premised on a whistleblower report and subsequently uncovered evidence indicating that Trump conditioned foreign aid to Ukraine on an investigation into his political rival for personal gain. Since the inquiry’s initiation in September, Trump has also publicly called on Chinese authorities to investigate Biden and his son’s activities in China. However, Nunes was careful in his request to avoid any of the inflammatory rhetoric that came ahead of it. Instead, he suggested merely that young Biden had insight on corruption in Ukraine that would be of use to Americans. Nunes noted his role as a Burisma board member and the fact that he was paid $50,000 a month while he served in that capacity. The Republican also pointed out that it was publicly reported that the younger Biden was hired to improve Burisma’s image at the same time Biden senior was charged with fighting Ukrainian corruption. “Biden’s firsthand experiences with Burisma can assist the American public in understanding the nature and extent of Ukraine’s pervasive corruption, information that bears directly on President Trump’s longstanding and deeply-held skepticism of the country,” Nunes explained. However, it seems highly unlikely that Schiff and his Democratic colleagues will agree that the younger Biden is key to the impeachment inquiry, especially not when he’s being presented as a witness who can justify the president’s skepticism of Ukraine. Democrats want to keep the focus on Trump and his actions, rather than on the Bidens. Naming the whistleblower Controversially, Nunes also asked that the whistleblower—whose report about a Trump phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky set off the chain of events leading to the current proceedings—be called to testify. That is another suggestion that seems likely to be rejected. Naming the report writer undermines the whole idea behind laws protecting those who speak up about possible wrongdoing. The president and other Republicans have continually called for release of this person’s name, saying that only the Inspector General can be prosecuted for outing them based on federal whistleblower law. But that is an extremely narrow reading of the law, and it’s been challenged by experts. Whatever happens, Republicans have already signaled that they won’t take any witness denials lying down. Nunes told Schiff in conclusion that his party will characterize denial of testimony by his proposed witnesses as “evidence…of denial of fundamental fairness and due process.”",CR,,1,"Nunes in his letter to Schiff today accused Democrats of fabricating sinister evidence against the president “out of thin air” and ignoring Trump’s due process rights while leaking cherry-picked information from a private investigation designed to mislead the public and damage the executive.|He referred to the “impeachment inquiry” in quotes to emphasize Republicans’ view that the investigation is illegitimate and wrote, “Americans see through this sham impeachment process, despite Democrats’ retroactive attempt to legitimize it last week.”|",1,"Today, Republican representative Devin Nunes, ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, sent Democrat Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, a very angry letter in response to his Nov. 6 correspondence (pdf) on the presidential impeachment-inquiry process.|The offer was, after all, intended to address Republicans’ complaints that Democrats are running secret proceedings without their involvement, and Schiff wants to seem reasonable and fair.|Nunes in his letter to Schiff today accused Democrats of fabricating sinister evidence against the president “out of thin air” and ignoring Trump’s due process rights while leaking cherry-picked information from a private investigation designed to mislead the public and damage the executive.",1,"Republicans seethe while suggesting impeachment-inquiry witnesses| Nunes in his letter to Schiff today accused Democrats of fabricating sinister evidence against the president “out of thin air” and ignoring Trump’s due process rights while leaking cherry-picked information from a private investigation designed to mislead the public and damage the executive.|He referred to the “impeachment inquiry” in quotes to emphasize Republicans’ view that the investigation is illegitimate and wrote, “Americans see through this sham impeachment process, despite Democrats’ retroactive attempt to legitimize it last week.”"

6507,http://cnn.com/2019/11/09/europe/berlin-wall-30-years-intl-grm/index.html,0,0,,,,,0,,,Germany marks 30 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall,"(CNN)European leaders gathered in Berlin on Saturday to mark 30 years since the fall of the wall that divided East and West Berlin, where German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Europe to defend democracy and freedom. Leaders from Central and Eastern Europe gathered in the German capital to celebrate the pivotal moment in history that marked the end of communism and the reunification of the country. A number of events took place across the city, which included the commemoration ceremony at the Berlin Wall Memorial that leaders attended. During the commemoration, Merkel said European values must not be taken for granted. ""The values that Europe is based on -- freedom, democracy, equality, rule of law, human rights -- these are not to be taken for granted,"" Merkel said. ""We always have to defend them. ""In the future Europe will [continue to] be fighting for human rights, tolerance and democracy."" she added. ""This is a time of global changes, so this is a pressing issue."" Candles were also being lit for victims of communist violence and celebrations continued into the evening at the Brandenburg Gate -- the symbol of a reunified Germany which once stood at the center of the no man's land between East and West. The seismic event of the fall of the Berlin wall sent shock waves across Europe 30 years ago, and sparked hopes for millions of East Germans. On August 13, 1961, citizens woke up to find a makeshift barricade of barbed wire and cinder blocks that sliced through their city. The barrier evolved over the next three decades into a 45-kilometer concrete wall, which symbolized the deep ideological divide between the Soviet bloc and the West at the height of the Cold War. The three-and-a-half meter deep wall was fortified with watchtowers, electric fences and armed guards. On November 9 in 1989, jubilant crowds stormed the concrete blockade, just minutes after the Communist German Democratic Republic (GDR) announced that travel restrictions would be lifted for east Germans. The propaganda and fear were replaced with a sense of freedom and unity. However, despite the fall of the wall, three decades later an invisible barrier still stretches across Germany. While slowly disintegrating, the divide remains. According to Steffen Mau, a sociology professor at Berlin's Humboldt University many gaps, particularly the economic ones have narrowed but people still have ""strong differences in attitudes and mentality."" Even the way people see themselves and their country varies. Mau explains that most west Germans say there is ""no difference any more ... while most east Germans would say there is still a striking difference between East and West."" According to some surveys, he added, as many as half of east Germans still feel like ""second-class citizens."" In terms of wealth, the six eastern states had a lot of catching up to do when the Wall came down. And while a big chunk of that gap has closed over the past three decades, the East is still lagging behind, in terms of both GDP and incomes.",CR,,0,||,0,||,0,||

Gerrymandering -- the dark art of drawing political maps to favor one party and disadvantage the other, which can be traced back to the earliest days of the nation -- fundamentally altered the nature of political representation in the largest city in western North Carolina.Artists, independent spirits and environmentalists have traditionally flocked to this hippie enclave, surrounded by conservative hill towns, for the majestic Blue Ridge Mountains, thriving local brewpubs, vegan cafes and independent bookstores. And, a decade ago, North Carolina's 11th congressional district, with Asheville at its heart, was among the nation's most competitive, see-sawing with shifting political winds. It favored Republicans during the two elections that followed the September 11 attacks, then veered toward Democrats beginning in 2006 as the Iraq war stagnated and stock market tumbled. This district does not swing any longer. Asheville is now represented by two of the most conservative members of Congress, including the outgoing chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, who have won their races since 2012 by double-digit averages.Why? Because while the old map preserved Asheville in one competitive district, the new one sliced the city in half, scattering its voters across two districts in a way that ensured a Republican captured both seats.But when the 11th district switched from a toss-up to safely Republican, the entire political dynamic changed. Without a competitive general election, the real action moved to the GOP primary, where turnout tends to be lower, and limited to the activist base. Only the most ideological extreme candidates stood a chance. Enter Mark Meadows, who won the 2012 GOP primary here with a vow to ""send Mr. Obama home to Kenya or wherever it is."" He's held the seat since. Once arriving in Washington, Meadows ousted then-GOP Speaker John Boehner with a parliamentary maneuver, and became the architect of the 2013 government shutdown, as well as multiple Obamacare repeal efforts. And he's now one of President Donald Trump's most ardent defenders against impeachment. Not surprisingly, many locals are unhappy with this reality. ""The majority of the electorate in Asheville feels that their views are not represented in Congress,"" Mayor Esther Manheimer said in March. The matter is not settled; judges recently blocked the congressional map from being used in 2020 elections.Of course, this story is not unique to Asheville. All over the country, partisans have cracked cities in two, drawn districts that look like Donald Duck kicking Goofy and exploited new technology and advanced data to maximize gains. And the consequences for democracy continue to be catastrophic, locking in a new era of minority rule across multiple states, distorting the competitive balance of congressional delegations and placing public policy -- and many politicians -- beyond the reach of the ballot box. But which came first: the extreme gerrymanders or the heightened polarization? The reality is that each acts as an accelerant on the other, exacerbating a situation these politicians candidly describe in amicus briefs before the US Supreme Court as a Montague vs. Capulet-styled Shakespearean bloodbath. Gerrymandered districts have also helped create an epidemic of minority rule nationwide, driving state politics to extremes not supported by voters who find themselves unable to do anything about it. Almost 60 million Americans live in a state where one or both chambers of legislature is controlled by the party that won fewer statewide votes in the 2018 election. A new study finds that with fair lines, 59 congressional seats would have changed hands in 2012, 2014 and 2016. (Republicans gained 39 seats they would not have won; Democrats secured 20.) Of course, gerrymandering has been part of our politics from the start. The bad news for democracy is that we're better at gerrymandering than ever before. Powerful computers, sophisticated mapping software and terabytes of voter, census and consumer data -- alongside growing polarization -- make it possible to draw surgical district lines that provide sturdy bulwarks against electoral waves and maximize partisan advantage across an entire state. It's more than geography: Multiple academic studies, involving tens of thousands of neutral maps, consistently show that the partisan-drawn maps in the most gerrymandered states are radical outliers. Neither political party has more historical virtue when it comes to gerrymandering, but GOP strategists outplayed their DNC counterparts ahead of the 2010 election, recognizing that redistricting provided a path back to power after the party's 2008 walloping at the hands of President Barack Obama. In fact, the GOP invested $30 million into state legislative races in closely divided states like Ohio, Wisconsin and North Carolina, seeking to win full control of congressional and state legislative maps. The lines Republicans drew the following year stuck.It was a political masterstroke: Every 10 years, following the census, congressional lines are redrawn to account for population changes. In most states, the state legislature takes the lead, so the GOP's modest investment paid handsome dividends. (As a result, Democrats controlled the process in fewer states than Republicans, so they lacked the same opportunities to gerrymander in 2010. They did take full advantage of their biggest opportunity, drawing a map that pushed their advantage in Maryland all the way to 7-1.) But most Americans vote in uncompetitive districts, where the outcome is pre-ordained and reflective of only the most partisan extremes. Uncompetitive districts elect a different kind of politician, who is then incentivized to cater only to their base. Congress, meanwhile, has an approval rating in the upper teens, yet upward of 95% of incumbents coast to re-election. No wonder Americans feel frustrated. It doesn't have to be this way. Americans hate gerrymandering and believe in fair elections, evident by the various initiatives and constitutional amendments that passed in 2018, including successful efforts to stop politicians from drawing their own districts and choosing their own voters in Michigan, Missouri, Colorado, Ohio and Utah.

7028,http://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/warrior-iconic-iwo-jima-flag-raising-photo-was-misidentified-marines-n1064766,1,0,,,,,0,,,"Warrior in iconic Iwo Jima flag-raising photo was misidentified, Marines Corps acknowledges","The list of heroes immortalized in the iconic photo of the U.S. flag being raised over Iwo Jima has been revised again. The Marine Corps acknowledged on Wednesday that for 74 years, it had misidentified one of the six fighting men who appeared in the Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal. The admission came after three historians, using film footage from atop Mount Suribachi and photos taken by other soldiers who were there, concluded that Cpl. Harold “Pie” Keller — not Pfc. Rene Gagnon — was one of the flag-raisers in the photograph. The findings of historians Stephen Foley, Dustin Spence and Brent Westemeyer were confirmed by a special investigative board convened by the Marines and by investigators from the FBI's Digital Evidence Laboratory. ""Without the initiative and contributions of both private historians devoted to preservation of our history and the FBI’s Digital Evidence Laboratory, the Marine Corps would not have this opportunity to expand on the historical record of the second flag raising on Mount Suribachi,"" the Marine Corps said in a statement. The addition of Keller's name comes three years after an earlier Marine Corps inquiry concluded that Pfc. Harold Schultz was one of the six flag-raisers, not Navy hospital corpsman John Bradley as had been believed for seven decades. ""Regardless of who was in the photograph, each and every Marine who set foot on Iwo Jima, or supported the effort from the sea and air around the island is, and always will be, a part of our Corps’ cherished history,"" the Marines' statement read. ""In the words of General David H. Berger, Commandant of the Marine Corps, 'they are all heroes.'” The discovery that Keller, a Purple Heart recipient who fought in the biggest battles of the Pacific theater, was in the Rosenthal photo came as a shock to his family in Brooklyn, Iowa. “He never spoke about any of this when we were growing up,” Keller’s daughter, Kay Maurer, 70, told NBC News. “We knew he fought in the war, we knew he was wounded in the shoulder at one point...But he didn’t tell us he helped raise the flag on Mount Suribachi.” There was evidence Keller was there hanging in plain sight on the family’s living room wall — a framed photo of another renowned Rosenthal photo from Feb. 23, 1945, the so-called Gung Ho shot of 18 Marines on the summit with the flag in the background, Maurer said. “Now we know he’s in that photo, too,” Maurer said of her father, who got his nickname after he ate too much pie before a football game and threw up in front of his friends. “When I would ask him about the photo on our wall, he would say something like, ‘That group raised a flag.’ He just never spoke much about this when we were growing up.” Keller and Gagnon both died of heart attacks in 1979. Keller was 57 and there was no mention of Iwo Jima in his obituary. Gagnon was 54 when he died seven months later and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. His obituary on the cemetery site refers to him as an ""Iwo Jima Flag Raiser."" There were actually two Iwo Jima flag-raisings on on Feb. 23, 1945, to signal that one of the bloodiest battles of World War II would soon be won. The first flag was deemed too small by military brass and replaced a few hours after it went up with a second, larger flag. Rosenthal's prize-wining picture was of the second flag-raising. ""Private First Class Gagnon played a significant role in the flag raising on Mount Suribachi and his role will never be diminished,"" the Marines said in a statement. ""He was directly responsible for getting the larger second flag to the top and returning the first flag for safe keeping. Without his efforts, this historical event might not have been captured, let alone even occurred."" Spence, Foley and Westmeyer are military historians who have long had a keen interest in Iwo Jima and what happened there. Foley, who is Irish, was one of the two historians who worked on confirming that Schultz was in the Rosenthal photo, not Bradley. Bradley was the subject of the bestseller “Flags of Our Fathers,” which was written by his son, James Bradley. It was later turned into a movie by Clint Eastwood. Maurer said Westemeyer had long harbored suspicions that Gagnon was not one of the six flag raisers. “The first time he thought it might be my dad was because of his stature,” she said. Keller was a strapping, square-jawed Marine while Gagnon was more slender and had a distinctive mole on this face, Westemeyer said. Westemeyer's suspicions hardened into certainty in 2014 after he immersed himself in the film footage that was taken on the summit by Sgt. Bill Genaust, a Marine cameraman who was killed in action a week later. “After watching Genaust’s footage a thousand times over, I was a 100 percent certain Gagnon was not in the number two position,” Westemeyer said. Westemeyer was referring to the position of the men who appear in the Rosenthal photo, which until Wednesday was, from left to right, Ira Hayes, Schultz, Michael Strank, Franklin Sousley, Gagnon and Harlon Block. Of the six figures in the photo, the man in the position second from the right is the most obscured in Rosenthal’s photo. Westemeyer, who lives in Iowa, said he shared his belief with Foley via an Iwo Jima forum to which they both belonged. Foley, in turn, had been in contact with the California-based Spence. “I started peppering Steve, ‘It’s Harold ‘Pie’ Keller,’” Westemeyer said. They compared stills from Genaust’s footage with photographs of the scene taken from different vantage points by other photographers who were there, including Army Pft. George Burns. Spence tracked down the Burns photographs at Foley's urging and after reading an NBC News article in 2016 about Burns and another forgotten military photographer, Marine Sgt. Louis Burmeister. Foley then tracked down a photograph in 2017 taken by Marine Pvt. Bob Campbell, which showed two men saluting as the six men are raising the flag. Also, a closer look at Rosenthal’s prize-winning photo revealed what appeared to be the “reflection of a ring” on the left hand of the man in the second spot, Spence said. “Keller was married, Gagnon wasn’t,” Spence said. In fact, Keller met and married his wife, Ruby, in a “whirlwind romance” while home on leave in February 1944, Spence said. There were other clues in the photographs they collected, Spence said, like the camouflage pattern and creases on Keller’s helmet matching that of the man in the second spot. But it was a Campbell photo that shows Gagnon, with his telltale mole visible, reaching for the first flag while Keller and the others are raising the second flag on the summit that sealed it for the historians. ""Campbell's Exchange photo was made public many, many moons ago,"" Westemeyer said. ""We simply did not focus on who was lowering number one."" Keller was slated to go to officer training school at Quantico, Virginia, when the war ended and he decided, instead, to go home. He returned to his job as a telephone lineman and raised two sons and his daughter, Kay. “I think he just came home and wanted to put it all behind him,” Maurer said. “Just carry on.” Maurer could recall only a couple of other tidbits from the war that his father told her. “Once he told me what jungle rot was,” she said. “The other thing we knew about was that he got to see Eleanor Roosevelt when she visited the troops.” Maurer said she learned from her mother that her father had nightmares from time to time when he first came home from the war. She said that, in time, they stopped. But habits her father picked up in the service stuck with him. “When he ate, he would always leave a little food on his plate,” Maurer said. “We were always told to clean our plates but he never did. Finally I asked him why and he said: ‘When I was in the war, we weren’t always sure when we would get our rations. So I would save a bit. I can’t break that habit now.’”",CR,,0,||,0,||,0,||

7839,http://dailycaller.com/2019/10/16/chick-fil-a-uganda-fact-check/,1,0,,,,,0,,,Snopes Butchers Fact Check Of Viral Smear Of Chick-Fil-A,"""Fact-checking website Snopes butchered its fact check of a viral but false tweet linking Chick-fil-A to anti-gay legislation in Uganda. A Ugandan official announced plans on Oct. 10 to reintroduce a bill providing the death penalty for homosexuality, though a spokesperson for the Ugandan president has since said that there “are no plans by the government to introduce a law like that.”"" A false tweet blaming Chick-fil-A for the possible legislation quickly went viral, receiving more than 57,000 thousand retweets and 118,000 thousand likes on Twitter. “Today Uganda announced a bill to legalize murdering gay people. National Christian Organization paid a preacher to go to Uganda and help their lawmakers with the bill. Chick-fil-a funds National Christian Org,” the Oct. 12 tweet said, adding: “If you eat at Chick-fil-a, this is what your money goes to.” In ensuing tweets, the Twitter user posted links to two outdated articles, neither of which proved the tweet’s claims. The first link, a Business Insider article from 2012, noted that the WinShape Foundation, a nonprofit funded by Chick-fil-A and its owners, donated to the National Christian Foundation (NCF) in 2010. The NCF is one of the country’s largest Christian nonprofits and provides funding to thousands of Christian charities and churches, including some that operate in Uganda. The Daily Caller News Foundation reviewed the WinShape Foundation’s tax returns between 2010 and 2017 (the most recent year available) and found that WinShape stopped donating to the NCF after 2011. There is no indication that Chick-fil-A is currently funding the NCF, much less bankrolling changes in Ugandan legislation through the NCF. The second article, a 2014 blog post, asserted links between NCF-funded churches and anti-gay movements in Uganda, though even Snopes conceded that there’s no evidence that “NCF-funded groups are involved in any potential renewed efforts” to pass a death penalty law for homosexuality in Uganda. Snopes rated the false tweet a “mixture” of truth and fact in its fact check, which incorrectly indicated that WinShape currently funds NCF. “For several years, the WinShape Foundation has provided some funding to the NCF, in particular, as shown in the charity’s annual tax documents,” Snopes writer Dan Macguill asserted Tuesday. Macguill added later that “it’s absolutely true that the WinShape Foundation, which was founded by the Cathy family, is still run by them, and receives almost all of its funding from Chick-fil-A, has for several years provided funding to several Christian conservative groups and projects, including the NCF.” The Snopes writer appears to have gotten it wrong. Winshape’s tax documents — which Macguill linked to in the story — show that NCF donated to the WinShape Foundation in 2017, not the other way around. Neither WinShape nor the Chick-fil-A Foundation, the company’s charitable arm, donated to the NCF in 2017, the most recent year publicly available, according to tax documents the DCNF reviewed. “Chick-fil-A has not supported legislative campaigns of any kind in Uganda,” a Chick-Fil-A spokesman told the Washington Examiner’s Brad Polumbo, who criticized Snopes in a column Wednesday. Snopes, which did not return a request for comment, has previously struggled with accuracy. Snopes in January falsely ruled it “unproven” that Native American activist Nathan Phillips, who briefly shot to prominence after falsely accusing conservative high schoolers of racially harassing him, lied about being a Vietnam veteran, despite video evidence showing that he did.",CR,,0,||,0,||,0,||

Reps. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey and Collin Peterson of Minnesota both voted ""nay"" on the historic resolution. They also voted against going forward with resolution during the preliminary procedural vote. The resolution passed with a vote of 232-196. Their votes are no surprise as both were initially part of a group of Democrats who have not made public statements in support of starting an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump or have only posited conditional support for it. They also represent districts where Trump won in 2016. No Republicans supported the resolution. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, who is an independent and left the Republican party earlier this year, voted in favor. Van Drew said he believes the inquiry will ""further divide the country"" without bipartisan support. ""Without bipartisan support I believe this inquiry will further divide the country tearing it apart at the seams and will ultimately fail in the Senate,"" he said in a statement after the vote on Thursday. ""However, now that the vote has taken place and we are moving forward I will be making a judgment call based on all the evidence presented by these investigations. My hope is that we are still able to get some work done to help the American people like infrastructure, veterans' benefits, environmental protections, immigration reform, reducing prescription drug cost, and strengthening Social Security."" Peterson called the House vote on the resolution ""unnecessary"" and said he ""will not make a decision on impeachment until all the facts have been presented."" ""This impeachment process continues to be hopelessly partisan.

6413,http://businessinsider.com/who-is-amy-klobuchar-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3,1,0,,,0,,0,,,Amy Klobuchar ran for president in 2020. Here's everything we know about the candidate and her platform.,"Who is Amy Klobuchar? Current job: US Senator from Minnesota since 2006 and 2020 presidential candidate. Age: 59 Family: Klobuchar is married to attorney John Bessler, with whom she has a 23-year-old daughter named Abigail. Hometown: Plymouth, Minnesota. Political party: Democratic/Democratic-Farmer-Labor. Previous jobs: Corporate lawyer, partner at Minnesota law firms Dorsey & Whitney and Gray Plant Moody, Hennepin County Attorney from 1999 to 2006. Who was Amy Klobuchar's direct competition for the nomination? Based on a recurring series of national surveys we conduct, we can figure out who the other candidates competing in Amy Klobuchar's lane are, and who the broader opponents are within the party. Insider has been conducting a recurring poll through SurveyMonkey Audience on a national sample to find out how different candidate's constituencies overlap. We ask people whether they are familiar with a candidate, whether they would be satisfied or unsatisfied with that candidate as nominee, and sometimes we also ask whether they think that person would win or lose in a general election against President Donald Trump. What are Amy Klobuchar's policy positions? On healthcare At a March CNN town hall, Klobuchar said that while she wants to see universal healthcare coverage become a reality in the US, she does not support Medicare for All, calling it an ""aspiration."" At the Democratic primary debate in August, Klobuchar expressed her opposition to eliminating private health insurance under Medicare for All. ""Bernie wrote the bill, but I read the bill. And on page 8, it says that we will no longer have private insurance as we know it. That means 149 million Americans will no longer be able to have their current insurance. And I don't think that's a bold idea, I think it's a bad idea."" She added: ""what I support is something Barack Obama wanted to do from the beginning, which creates a public option: a nonprofit choice that will bring down the costs of insurance, cover 12 million more people, and bring down costs for 13 million more people."" She supports lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 55, and co-sponsored a bill introduced by Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii that would create an expanded public option to allow people to buy into Medicaid or Medicare at a reasonable price. Klobuchar has also sponsored bipartisan legislation that would lower the cost of prescription drugs, and allow Medicaid to directly negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies. On immigration: Klobuchar voted for 2013 immigration legislation to provide a path to citizenship to most undocumented immigrants without criminal records and increase the availability of skills-based visas while allocating more funding for border security. ""Our state's economy is so strong and we rely on legal immigrant employees to work at the turkey farms, out in the farm fields and other places like health care assistance,"" Klobuchar said in 2018. She does not support abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), but believes the agency should be reformed. On climate change: Klobuchar does not currently support the Green New Deal, but says she would have the US re-join the Paris Accords if she became president. The international agreement — which the Trump administration pulled the US out of — aims to decrease greenhouse gas emissions 45% by the year 2030 and expand renewable energy output. At a September CNN climate town hall, Klobuchar argued in favor of carbon pricing and a plan to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 while embracing natural gas a ""transition"" fuel to help the US move away from foreign oil. Klobuchar also expressed interest in working with the meat and dairy industries to lower their carbon footprint and water usage, saying, ""I am hopeful that we can do this in a way, when I'm president, where we can continue to have hamburgers and cheese."" On campaign finance/election reform: Klobuchar supports automatic voter registration for Americans, and introduced legislation in 2017 that would have automatically registered people who interacted with government agencies. As a member of the Senate Rules Committee, Klobuchar also introduced bipartisan election security legislation last year. She opposes the Citizens United decision and has sought to decrease the influence of money in politics. Her own campaign is refusing donations from corporate political action committees. At July's Democratic debate in Detroit, Klobuchar promised to confront corporate interests. ""What is broken is a political system that allows the NRA and other large, big money to come in and make things not happen when the majority of people are for [it],"" she said. ""As president, I will take them on."" On abortion: Klobuchar has consistently supported abortion rights in her voting record, earning a 100% alignment rating from Planned Parenthood. On LGBTQ rights Klobuchar supports same-sex marriage, and has pushed for measures to combat LGBTQ discrimination, writing in a 2013 report that discrimination is ""not only morally wrong"" but ""bad for business and hurts our economy. On education: While she doesn't support free, four-year college for all, Klobuchar supports reducing student debt burdens and increasing options for Americans to refinance their student loans. Klobuchar also supports expanding access to technical and vocational training, including introducing legislation to allow 529 education savings accounts to be used to fund vocational education. She's praised a plan introduced by 2020 rival Sen. Kamala Harris that would give US public school teachers an average $13,500 pay raise. On guns: Klobuchar is from a rural state with a strong hunting culture, joking that she doesn't want to hurt her ""Uncle Dick in the deer stand"" at a CNN town hall. She supports instituting universal background checks, banning assault rifles, and Extreme Risk Orders — also known as ""red flag"" laws — which allow law enforcement to remove guns from people they determine to be a threat. At the third Democratic debate in September, Klobuchar also backed a voluntary government buyback of semi-automatic weapons for people who want to surrender their guns. On criminal justice reform: Klobuchar, a former prosecutor, recently came out in support of marijuana legalization, saying she believes that ""states should have the right to determine the best approach to marijuana within their borders."" Klobuchar previously supported the STATES Act, which would have prohibited the Department of Justice from cracking down on marijuana in states that have legalized the drug. On trade: Klobuchar has previously supported US tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum imports, according to CNBC. She's criticized the Trump administration, however, for the damage retaliatory tariffs imposed by China have caused to the Midwest's rural farmers. At the third Democratic debate in September, Klobuchar said, ""[Trump] has assessed these tariffs on our allies, he's putting us in the middle of this trade war, and he's using our farmers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos. And if we are not careful, he will bankrupt this country."" On foreign policy: Klobuchar opposed Trump withdrawing troops from Syria earlier this year, voting for a Senate legislation which rebuffed his decision, PBS reported. She's criticized Trump for becoming friendlier with US adversaries like Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un while distancing himself from traditional American allies, telling MSNBC's Rachel Maddow she believes America must ""stand as a beacon of democracy."" She took a dig at Trump's foreign policy at her campaign launch, saying ""we must respect our frontline troops, diplomats, and intelligence officers … they deserve better than foreign policy by tweet."" On taxes: Klobuchar's Senate website says she supports legislation that would ""simplify the tax code, close wasteful loopholes, bring back money U.S. companies are holding overseas to fund infrastructure projects here at home, and provide incentives to keep jobs in America."" She criticized the 2018 Republican tax reform bill, saying it ""created a terrible incentive to move jobs and operations abroad to take advantage of tax havens."" On jobs and the economy: Klobuchar supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Klobuchar supports expanding export markets for US goods, especially those made by small businesses, as well as decreasing red tape and burdensome regulations that hinder small business growth. Klobuchar also recently rolled out an ambitious $1 trillion plan to upgrade and invest in America's infrastructure, which she says will create thousands of good-paying jobs. At the fifth Democratic debate in Atlanta, Klobuchar advocated for a three-month paid family leave policy. On technology: Klobuchar represents many rural communities in Minnesota, and has secured federal funding to expand broadband internet in rural areas, as well as improving the quality of infrastructure in rural areas. As a former corporate lawyer specializing in telecommunications, Klobuchar has also introduced legislation implementing stronger privacy regulations on tech companies and supports preventing the proliferation of tech monopolies by limiting big firms from acquiring or merging with other ones. What are Amy Klobuchar's political successes? Klobuchar's first foray into politics was successfully lobbying for the enactment of a Minnesota law that required insurance plans to cover new mothers being able to stay in the hospital 48 hours after giving birth. In 2016, Klobuchar sponsored or co-sponsored 27 bills that were signed into law, more than any other senator that year. Two bipartisan bills Klobuchar introduced to combat the opioid crisis in 2018 were passed and signed into law. Klobuchar was the lead author of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which banned lead in children's products, among other provisions. She described it as the ""most sweeping reform"" of consumer product safety law in ""decades."" Where did Amy Klobuchar poll best? Based on the 12 polls conducted by Insider since late August, we can gather a sense of the geographic regions where candidates are overperforming when it comes to how satisfied voters would be if they were chosen as the presidential nominee. Though the first four primaries are in the Western Midwest, New England, the South Atlantic and Mountain regions, the four regions that allocate the bulk of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention are the South Atlantic (16%), Pacific (16%), Mid-Atlantic (16%) and Eastern Midwest (15%). Voters in the West Midwest were most satisfied with Klobuchar as a candidate at a rate of 15.3 percentage points over other regions. She also does well in the Western South (+3.3 percentage points) and New England (+2.6 percentage points). She polls worst in the Mountain region (-3.8 percentage points) and Eastern South (-9.5 percentage points). How was Amy Klobuchar viewed by different wings of the Democratic party? Klobuchar does especially well among those who identified as moderately liberal, though also does really well among those who identify as slightly liberal. She lags among respondents who identify as very liberal. How much money has Amy Klobuchar raised? After her breakout third-place finish and surge in the February 11 New Hampshire primary, Klobuchar's campaign announced she raised a stunning sum of $12 million in the following days, further propelling her momentum. Could Amy Klobuchar have beat President Trump? Referring back to Insider's recurring poll, Amy Klobuchar overall is believed to be a much weaker candidate in a general election against Donald Trump compared to the whole field. Based on responses from Democratic primary voters, for a typical candidate surveyed about a third of respondents think they'd win, and another third think they'd lose. Despite largely running on her own electability, Klobuchar comes in a bit low: only about 15% think she'd win. How was Amy Klobuchar viewed by voters compared to the competition? Insider has conducted a number of other polls to check in on how these candidates are perceived in comparison to one another. When we asked respondents to one poll to rank how far to the left or to the right they considered the candidates, Klobuchar was generally considered to be one of the more right-leaning or centrist candidates in the field, and the most right-leaning of the top tier of candidates to which she is in now. Klobuchar was among the more experienced candidates in the field by far when we asked respondents to rank the candidates based on how prepared they are for the rigors of the presidency given what they knew about their history of public service and experience with government. And when asked how likable or personable respondents perceived the candidates to be, Klobuchar was in the middle of the pack. Recently, Klobuchar emphasized her experience in government and took a shot at the 37-year-old upstart presidential candidate Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, telling CNN that a woman with Buttigieg's comparable lack of government experience wouldn't qualify for a Democratic debate. ""I'm the one from the Midwest that has actually won in a statewide race over and over again,"" she said. ""Those are the kind of voters I have won. And that's not true of Mayor Pete. That's just a fact."" How did Democratic voters feel about Amy Klobuchar's qualifications? Insider has conducted polling about how voters feel about candidate attributes or qualifications. We asked respondents about a list of possible qualifications and if they made them more likely or less likely to vote for a candidate for president. For example, among respondents who said they'd vote in the Democratic primary, 19% said a candidate being a college professor made them likelier to support them, while 4% said it made them less likely to, for a +15% net favorability. We can then see how different candidates' resumes stack up compared to those preferences. Attributes perceived as most valuable include her released tax returns (+43%), position in the Senate (+40%), middle-class upbringing (+36%), Ivy league education (+7%) and past as a lawyer (+3%). Attributes considered to be a liability based on the preferences of self-reported Democratic voters include her history as a prosecutor (-1%) and corporate lawyer (-33%).

While conservatives have long outnumbered liberals and moderates across the U.S., the study sheds new light on state-by-state patterns. The map below shows the pattern for the 50 states and the District of Columbia.Mississippi is the first state with more than 50% conservative identification, with Idaho, Alabama, Wyoming, and Utah approaching that level, and Arkansas, South Carolina, North Dakota, Louisiana, and South Dakota (the rest of the top-ten conservative states) 45% or higher. Conservatives outnumber liberals in even the most liberal-leaning states (excluding the District of Columbia): Vermont, (30.7% conservative to 30.5% liberal), Rhode Island (29.9% to 29.3%), and Massachusetts (29.9% to 28.0%). Political commentators have long pointed to underlying social and economic sorting that underpins this growing conservative/ liberal divide. But what factors account for the growing conservatism of Americans and American states? With the help of my colleague Charlotta Mellander, I decided to take a look. We ran a simple correlation analysis on the Gallup poll numbers, comparing conservative identification to a variety of key economic, demographic, and cultural factors by state. As always, our analysis only points to associations between variables; we do not make any claims about causation and note that other factors that we have not looked at might come into play. Still, a number of intriguing findings cropped up. Not surprisingly, states with more conservatives are considerably more religious than liberal-leaning states. The correlation between conservative political affiliation and religion (the share of state population for which religion is an important part of daily life) is considerable (.63)Conservative states are also less well-educated than liberal ones. The correlation between conservative affiliation and human capital (that is, the percent of adults who have graduated college) is substantially negative (-.53). States with more conservatives are less diverse. Conservative political affiliation is highly negatively correlated with the percent of the population that are immigrants (-.59) or gay and lesbian (-.66).Conservative states are more blue-collar. Conservative political affiliation is strongly positively correlated with the percentage of the workforce in blue-collar occupations (.73) and highly negatively correlated with the proportion of the workforce engaged in knowledge-based professional and creative work (-.61)States with more conservatives are considerably poorer than those with more liberals. Conservative political affiliation is highly negatively correlated with income ( -.65) and even more so with hourly earnings (-.79). Columbia University's Andrew Gelman's influential book Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State sheds light on this phenomenon. While rich voters trend Republican, Gelman and his colleagues found, rich states trend Democratic.Conservatism, at least at the state level, appears to be growing stronger. Ironically, this trend is most pronounced in America's least well-off, least educated, most blue collar, most economically hard-hit states. Conservatism, more and more, is the ideology of the economically left behind. The current economic crisis only appears to have deepened conservatism's hold on America's states. This trend stands in sharp contrast to the Great Depression, when America embraced FDR and the New Deal. Liberalism, which is stronger in richer, better-educated, more-diverse, and, especially, more prosperous places, is shrinking across the board and has fallen behind conservatism even in its biggest strongholds. This obviously poses big challenges for liberals, the Obama administration, and the Democratic Party moving forward. But the much bigger, long-term danger is economic rather than political. This ideological state of affairs advantages the policy preferences of poorer, less innovative states over wealthier, more innovative, and productive ones. American politics is increasingly disconnected from its economic engine. And this deepening political divide has become perhaps the biggest bottleneck on the road to long-run prosperity.

The tipping point for Pelosi — along with other House Democrats once skeptical of pursuing impeachment — are the revelations that Trump tried to pressure the Ukrainian president into investigating Joe Biden’s son. Pelosi made that clear on Tuesday. “The president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,” Pelosi said in a brief speech to reporters. “The actions of the Trump presidency revealed dishonorable facts of betrayal of his oath of office and betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.” Pelosi continued: “Therefore, today, I’m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry and directing our six committees to proceed with their investigation under that umbrellas of impeachment inquiry.” “No one is above the law,” she said. This is an incredible reversal for Pelosi, who has resisted pursuing impeachment in the wake of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, and she continued to do so last week, even as details of a whistleblower complaint began to leak — specifically that Trump may used his dealings with a foreign power to damage a 2020 political rival. “Getting back to our founders, in the darkest days of the American revolution, Thomas Paine wrote, ‘the times have found us,’” Pelosi said. “The times found them to fight and establish our democracy. The times have found us today. Not to place ourselves in the same greatness as our founders but in protecting and defending our Constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic.” The swiftness of this decision — after months of dragging after special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation concluded — only underscores the truly monumental nature of Pelosi’s announcement. This is only the fourth time in US history that the House of Representatives have launched a formal impeachment process against a president, putting Trump in small, and ignominious, company. Trump, still in New York City at the United Nations, blasted Pelosi’s announcement immediately on Twitter, calling it “breaking news Witch Hunt garbage” and “PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!” Pelosi’s earlier reticence toward an impeachment inquiry over Trump was largely based on the mood of moderate House Democrats in vulnerable districts and a public that wasn’t eager for a messy, divisive political fight ahead of the 2020 presidential elections. Now, Pelosi is saying Trump’s transgressions are too urgent to ignore. Whether the rest of the House of Representatives — let alone the Senate, or the country will agree, will be battled out over the coming weeks and months. Here’s a rush transcript of Pelosi’s full statement, below. Last Tuesday, we had the anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution on September 17. Sadly on that day, the intelligence community inspector general formally notified the Congress that the administration was forbidding him from turning over a whistleblower complaint on Constitution Day. This is a violation of law. Shortly thereafter, press reports began to break of a phone call by the president of the United States calling upon a foreign power to intervene in his election. This is a breach of his constitutional responsibilities. The facts are these: The intelligence community inspector general, who is appointed by President Trump, determined that the complaint is both of urgent concern and credible. And its disclosure relates to one of the most significant and importance of director of national intelligence responsibility to the American people. On Thursday, the inspector general testified before the House Intelligence Committee stating that the acting director of national intelligence blocked him from disclosing the whistleblower complaint. This is a violation of law. The law is: The DNI, director of national intelligence, shall provide Congress the full whistleblower complaint. For more than 25 years, I served on the Intelligence Committee as a member, as the ranking member, as part of the Gang of Four even before I was in the leadership. I was there when we created the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. That did not exist before 2004. I was there even earlier when we wrote the whistleblower laws and continued to write them to improve them to ensure the security of our intelligence and the safety of our whistleblowers. I know what their purpose was, and we proceeded to balance and caution as we wrote the laws. I can say with authority that the Trump administration’s actions undermine both the national security and our intelligence and our protections of whistleblowers. The acting DNI will appear before the House Intelligence Committee and must turn over the full complaint to the committee. He will have to choose whether to break the law or honor his responsibility to the constitution. On the final day of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, when our Constitution was adopted, Americans gathered on the steps of Independence Hall to break the news the government our founders had crafted, “What do we have, a republic or monarchy?” [Benjamin] Franklin replied, “A Republic if you keep it.” Our responsibility is to keep it. The wisdom of our Constitution enshrined in three co-equal branches of government serving as checks and balances on each other. The actions taken by the president have seriously violated the Constitution, when the president says “Article 2 says I can do whatever I want.” For the past several months we have been investigating in our committees and litigating in the courts so the House can gather all the relevant facts and whether to exercise its Article 1 powers, including a constitutional power of the utmost gravity of articles of impeachment. And this week, the president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically. The actions of the Trump presidency revealed dishonorable facts of betrayal of his oath of office and betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections. Therefore, today I’m announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry and directing our six committees to proceed with their investigation under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry. No one is above the law. Getting back to our founders, in the darkest days of the American Revolution, Thomas Paine wrote, “The times have found us.” The times found them to fight and establish our democracy. The times have found us today. Not to place ourselves in the same greatness as our founders but in protecting and defending our Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic. In the words of Ben Franklin, “to keep our republic.” I thank our chairmen, Chairman Nadler, Chairman Schiff, Chairman Engel, Chairman Cummings of Oversight. Chairman Cummings and I have been in touch with [each other] constantly. He is a master of so much, including inspectors general and whistleblowers. Chairman Richard Neal, Congresswoman Maxine Waters of the Financial Services Committee. And I commend all of our members, our colleagues for their thoughtful, thoughtful approach to all of this for their careful statements. God bless them, and God bless America.",CR,,1,"Pelosi made that clear on Tuesday. “The president has admitted to asking the president of Ukraine to take actions which would benefit him politically,” Pelosi said in a brief speech to reporters. “The actions of the Trump presidency revealed dishonorable facts of betrayal of his oath of office and betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.”||",1,"The actions of the Trump presidency revealed dishonorable facts of betrayal of his oath of office and betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections,” the speaker of the House said Tuesday.|Trump, still in New York City at the United Nations, blasted Pelosi’s announcement immediately on Twitter, calling it “breaking news Witch Hunt garbage” and “PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!”|Now, Pelosi is saying Trump’s transgressions are too urgent to ignore.

I was in that meeting,” Grisham said. “The president walked in. He greeted everybody, as he does, and Speaker Pelosi started out the meeting – it was actually quite bizarre. She had no intentions of sitting there. We had military people. We had people there to brief them. And she was not going to listen.” “She got up. She stormed out. Her focus was getting to the cameras,” Grisham continued. “It was funny to watch Schumer chase after her. I think he was a little worried that if he didn’t leave with her, that she would get angry with him.” “The president was measured. He stayed behind and he worked with the Democrats who actually remained behind, too,” Grisham concluded on the issue. “And we continued the briefing, and that was it. Again, this president has work to do. We’re not going to be swayed by all of the Dems and the theater that they continue to perform every day.” News of the meeting went instantly viral as Trump tweeted out a photo of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s meltdown inside the room, writing: “Nervous Nancy’s unhinged meltdown!” Outside the White House, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer addressed the media about what transpired, claiming that Trump called Pelosi a “third-rate politician” and told Democratic leaders regarding Syria, “There are communists involved, and you guys might like that.” The following is the full transcript of White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham’s interview on “Fox & Friends” provided via Fox News: DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The economy is booming. Our people are prospering. Our country is thriving. And our nation is stronger than ever before. But the more America achieves, the more hateful and enraged these crazy Democrats become. You know, I really don’t believe anymore that they love our country. I don’t believe it. CROWD (chanting): Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. (END VIDEO CLIP) STEVE DOOCY, FOX HOST: I think he likes that part. BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX HOST: Right. AINSLEY EARHARDT, FOX HOST: Four more years. KILMEADE: Twenty-eight minutes now before the top of the hour. Stephanie Grisham was there last night during the fun. And I imagine it seems like fun for just about everyone. We’ve had reporters there. And she joins us right now as White House press secretary among your many jobs. Stephanie, how hard was it for the president to turn the page on what he left in Washington, and the chaos from the day before with the speaker leaving the meeting along with Senator Schumer, and go onto that stage and put that behind him? STEPHANIE GRISHAM, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It wasn’t hard at all. The president is still working for this country. He went to Texas yesterday for an official event. He opened up a workshop, a new Louis Vuitton workshop that is supposed to bring 1,000 jobs into Texas. And then he went to that amazing rally. Full. More than 20,000 people there. He’s got no problem with continuing to work on behalf of the American people, talking about all that he’s doing for the American people. And the rest in Washington is just noise. It’s just the Dems doing what they do. DOOCY: Well, what they’re doing right now is there’s this impeachment inquiry, which Congress has not voted on, and the president has made it very clear, he said, look, you know, he said the president says he’s never done anything wrong as president and they’re just trying to re-litigate the 2016 election that they lost and they don’t like it. GRISHAM: That’s absolutely what they’re doing. It’s comical. You know, I mean, I was with the president on the campaign, of course, and then watching since the day we took office they have been throwing temper tantrum after temper tantrum trying to undo. And really it’s only gaining momentum. And the people of this country know what the Dems are doing. They’re tired of it. And, like I said, the president’s just going to still continue to work. He’s going to work on immigration, on health care, on bringing jobs to this country, on the economy, on the opioids crisis. He is a man who has a goal. He’s been successful all along. And the Dems are certainly not going to stop. It’s the JV. EARHARDT: So, Vice President Pence and Secretary Pompeo returned to Washington this morning. The president was touting the ceasefire. And then overnight there were more bombings and there was smoke in the air. Our reports are that civilians are losing their lives in this one city. They’re shelling. Smoke, machine gunfire. How is the president going to respond to this? GRISHAM: You know, I want to just say that the president, as president, has an obligation to look out for the troops and to protect this country. And when President Erdogan made it clear that he was going to invade, the president acted decisively to pull our military out of harm’s way. Now, he sent a delegation over and they were successful in a cease-fire, but that takes time. I’m not going to get into operations on the ground, of course. I’ll leave that to the Department of Defense. But the president is to protect our country. He is putting America first. He’s always said that. We’re not going to be in these never-ending wars anymore. And, again, as for the cease-fire, I’m really, really happy that our delegation was successful. And we’ll leave it at that. KILMEADE: Stephanie, a couple of things. We know what happened at the White House the other day, or there’s two different accounts of what took place. And you say the president was calm, cool, and collected. Nancy Pelosi said he had a meltdown. Now she says she wants all the meetings recorded. Will you record every meeting for the speaker? DOOCY: Yes, that worked out so well once upon a time. GRISHAM: Well, I mean, we would love for these impeachment inquiries to be transparent as well. We’d love for those meetings to be recorded or for us to have access to that. So maybe once she agrees to opening up this kangaroo court of hers, we could record the meetings that happen in the White House. I’ll tell you what. I was in that meeting. The president walked in. He greeted everybody, as he does. And Speaker Pelosi started out the meeting – it was actually quite bizarre. She had no intentions of sitting there. We had military people. We had people there to brief them, and she was not going to listen. She got up. She stormed out. Her focus was getting to the cameras. It was funny to watch Schumer chase after her. I think he was a little worried that if he didn’t leave with her, that she would get angry with him. I was in the meeting. The president was measured. He stayed behind and he worked with the Democrats who actually remained behind, too. And we continued the briefing, and that was it. Again, this president has work to do. We’re not going to be swayed by all of the Dems and the theater that they continue to perform every day. DOOCY: Well, I think that picture that we’re looking at right there is now Nancy Pelosi’s official Twitter picture where she is doing that right there next to the president. Speaking of the president, yesterday it was announced that apparently the G-7 Summit, which is going to be next year, during the summer – GRISHAM: Yes. DOOCY: Is going to be at Doral – GRISHAM: Correct. DOOCY: Which is the golf course resort owned by his family. And a lot of people are saying, number one, in the summer it’s really hot in Florida. Just telling you ahead of time. But the other thing is, you know, while the president might say, I’m not making any money off this thing, the promotional value, the marketing value is off the chart. GRISHAM: I don’t know if that’s the case. I’ll tell you what, the way the media, the mainstream media, is covering it, I don’t know that the Trump Organization would agree with that. I will tell you this, we – DOOCY: But everybody knows about it now. GRISHAM: Well, everybody knew about it before the president took office. I mean the Trump brand is known everywhere. And I do want to say this, we had members of our military office, Secret Service, advance teams, we had several people, the State Department, go out to 10 different states and look at 12 different sites. Doral was one of those sites. All of them came back and made the recommendations to the president that Doral is the perfect place to hold such a summit. You’ve got to imagine the things that go into looking at these sites. You need hotel rooms that will allow for the foreign delegations to come and their staff. Transportation needs to be nearby. Airports, hospitals, helicopter landing zones. We had one site that we looked at, I won’t name what site it was or what state was it is, but the altitude could have make people sick and oxygen tanks would have been brought in. So there’s a lot that goes into these things. KILMEADE: Denver. EARHARDT: Colorado. GRISHAM: Nope. Wrong. KILMEADE: OK. DOOCY: In the mountains. Somewhere in the mountains. KILMEADE: Not New Mexico. Stephanie, why didn’t you do the press conference yesterday? Why did Mick Mulvaney? And will we see you do these press conferences, which is traditionally what the While House press secretary does? GRISHAM: You know, right now, I’ve said this a bunch, if the president ever wants me to go out and take that podium, I will happily do it. I think as evidenced by yesterday with Mick, it was, again, more theater. It is about people wanting to be on TV and making names for themselves. And Mick took 30 – he was over there for more than 30 minutes. He took probably 40 questions. People were talking over one another. He did a great job. He mentioned the same message over and over and over and now the media, of course, is, you know, we put a statement out clarifying some of the things that the media got themselves in a tizzy over. But to answer your question, sure, I’ll do it if I need to, but this president speaks for himself every day. He offers opportunities for the press corps to ask him questions every day. And there really is no better spokesperson than the president. I’m doing TV interviews. I am doing many, many print interviews. I am out there to defend and talk about all of the accomplishments of this president. And I will continue to do that. It seems to be working right now. EARHARDT: Stephanie, the energy secretary, Rick Perry, told the president he plans to resign. Last night at the rally the president was complimenting him. So it seems – it appears that they still have an amicable relationship. What’s going on there? Why did he decide to step down? And what happens next? GRISHAM: Absolutely. So as the president said, he’s known about this for months. This was the plan for Secretary Perry all along, that it was time. He’s been with us from the beginning. And there’s going to be some next steps for him. I’m not going to get ahead of him, but he’s going to go on to great things and we wish him really, really well. KILMEADE: Right. So in other words – (CROSSTALK) DOOCY: So did Ukraine have anything to do with his departure? GRISHAM: Absolutely nothing. No, this was in the works for quite a while. As I said, the president’s known about it. Nothing like that. We wish him well. KILMEADE: Right. And he says that – the president said they already have somebody for the position already. Could you tell us who it is? GRISHAM: No, I cannot get in front of that. No way. KILMEADE: All right, do you want to tell Steve and then Steve could tell me later? DOOCY: Good idea. GRISHAM: Sure, I’ll do that after we’re done here. KILMEADE: Oh, after we’re done. OK. DOOCY: But the energy secretary has to have a lot of energy, right? We know that part. GRISHAM: Yes. DOOCY: All right. GRISHAM: Like everybody in this administration. DOOCY: We could figure that out. KILMEADE: All right. DOOCY: Stephanie Grisham, thank you very much for joining us from the bureau today. GRISHAM: Thank you guys for having me. EARHARDT: Thanks, Stephanie.",CR,,1,"Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham Shreds Pelosi Over Antics In Meeting With Trump|News of the meeting went instantly viral as Trump tweeted out a photo of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s meltdown inside the room, writing: “Nervous Nancy’s unhinged meltdown!”|Outside the White House, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer addressed the media about what transpired, claiming that Trump called Pelosi a “third-rate politician” and told Democratic leaders regarding Syria, “There are communists involved, and you guys might like that.”",1,"Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham Shreds Pelosi Over Antics In Meeting With Trump|Outside the White House, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer addressed the media about what transpired, claiming that Trump called Pelosi a “third-rate politician” and told Democratic leaders regarding Syria, “There are communists involved, and you guys might like that.”|",1,"“I’ll tell you what.

7181,http://time.com/5704639/all-women-spacewalk-live/,1,0,,,0,,0,,,The First All-Women Spacewalk Is Happening Now. Here's How to Watch It Live,"The first ever spacewalk by an all-women crew is happening today. Coverage began at 6:30 a.m. ET, and the astronauts are scheduled to enter the vacuum of space at 7:50 a.m. Astronaut Christina Koch, who is experienced in extravehicular activity (EVA), will lead the operation. She will be accompanied by astronaut Jessica Meir, who is making her first spacewalk on Friday. Both are American citizens. They will be in the vacuum of space for five and a half hours. You can watch the spacewalk live on TIME, above. Who are the astronauts? Christina Koch, 40, completed her NASA astronaut training in 2015, and has conducted four spacewalks. Friday’s will be her fifth. She has been on the International Space Station (ISS) since March 14, and is on track to set a record for the longest spaceflight by a woman, expected to be 328 days in space by the time she leaves. Jessica Meir, 42, also completed her training in 2015. She joined Koch on the ISS in September, on her first spaceflight. She holds dual U.S.-Swedish citizenship, making her the first Swedish woman in space. Friday will be her first spacewalk, and she is scheduled for two more. On Friday, Koch and Mier are replacing a battery unit on the outside of the ISS. Wasn’t this meant to happen earlier this year? Yes. In March, Koch and fellow astronaut Anne McClain were scheduled to perform a spacewalk. But just days before the two women were scheduled to make history, McClain was replaced by a male astronaut, Nick Hague. NASA blamed its lack of spacesuits in the correct size for both women. “We made a change in the astronauts to protect the safety of the crew and the timing of the mission,” NASA says in a post on its website. “Anne McClain made the decision to swap places with Nick Hague on the spacewalks planned for March 29 and April 8 so everyone could wear spacesuits that fit them best.” The u-turn provoked criticism from many, including Hillary Clinton, who urged NASA to “Make another suit.” NASA has said the milestone wasn’t planned, as the crew for spacewalks are selected based on their ability, but that it was inevitable as women constitute a growing percentage of all astronauts. In Koch and Meir’s 2013 class of NASA astronaut trainees, 50% are women. “The first all-woman spacewalk is a milestone worth noting and celebrating,” NASA said. “Our achievements provide inspiration to students around the world, proving that hard work can lead you to great heights, and all students should be able to see themselves in those achievements.” ",VC,,,,,,,

Cummings, a son of sharecroppers who rose to become one of the most powerful Democrats in Congress and a central figure in the impeachment investigation of President Trump, died on Thursday in Baltimore, his hometown. He was 68. His death, at Johns Hopkins Hospital, was confirmed by his wife, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, the Maryland State Democratic chairwoman. A spokeswoman, Trudy Perkins, said in a statement that Mr. Cummings died of “complications concerning longstanding health challenges.” No other details were given. Mr. Cummings, who was serving his 13th term in the House, had been in poor health. In recent years he had begun making his way around the Capitol in a motorized scooter and using a walker to steady himself. In 2017, he was in the hospital for two months after complications of a heart valve replacement, convinced, he told The New York Times in May, that he was “living on borrowed time.” With a booming voice and speaking cadence that hinted of the pulpit — his parents were preachers — Mr. Cummings was a compelling figure on Capitol Hill for more than two decades, repeatedly returned there by voters in Maryland’s Seventh Congressional District, which takes in much of Baltimore, including a section of the city with more than its share of social problems. He campaigned tirelessly for stricter gun control laws and help for those addicted to drugs. He was at times gruff, but always respected. But it was as chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform — the panel charged with maintaining integrity in government — that Mr. Cummings may have left his most lasting legacy. The position gave him sweeping power to investigate Mr. Trump and his administration, and he used it. He sparred with Mr. Trump in the most public of ways. In February, he summoned the president’s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to testify about hush money payments to women who claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump; Mr. Cohen denounced Mr. Trump as a “racist” and a “con man.” And he issued subpoenas for Mr. Trump’s financial records; Mr. Trump responded by suing him, prompting him to call the president’s effort to block congressional inquiries “far worse than Watergate.” In an interview with The Times in May, Mr. Cummings was asked what message he would like to send to the president. “I want to send a message that we have one life to live, Mr. President,” he replied. “This is no dress rehearsal. And that the American people simply want to live their lives without fear of their leaders. And we, as leaders, have a duty and a responsibility to keep our promise to them when we ran for office and won — and that is to make their lives better. While we’re all on this earth, that’s my message.” Even as his health kept him away from Washington in recent months, Mr. Cummings, a close ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, remained involved in the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump. Those close to him said that he joined strategy calls with Ms. Pelosi and other chairmen, and signed subpoenas from his hospital bed. “In the House, Elijah was our North Star,” Ms. Pelosi said in a statement. “He was a leader of towering character and integrity, whose stirring voice and steadfast values pushed the Congress and country to rise always to a higher purpose.” Mr. Trump, in turn, hurled insults at Mr. Cummings, calling him “racist” and “a brutal bully” who had done “a very poor job” representing his constituents in Baltimore, which the president declared a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.” But on Thursday Mr. Trump offered his condolences to Mr. Cummings’s family and praised the congressman on Twitter. “My warmest condolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings,” he wrote. “I got to see first hand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard, if not impossible, to replace!” In the Capitol, members of both parties praised Mr. Cummings for his social conscience and dogged determination. “I can’t tell you how many friends would call me and be in fear because they got a letter from Cummings,” Representative Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader, said on the House floor. “But he was a man of fairness.” Mr. Cummings prided himself on his slow, methodical manner, but he could also work himself into a fiery oration, when his brow would furrow deeply and his voice would quiver with emotion. When Hillary Clinton, then the former secretary of state, testified before the committee investigating the 2012 terrorist attack on Benghazi, Libya, Mr. Cummings, the panel’s top Democrat, flew into a fury as she withstood hours of withering questions from Republicans. “I don’t know what we want from you,” Mr. Cummings cried, accusing Republicans of using taxpayer dollars to try to destroy Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign. “Do we want to badger you over and over again until you do get so tired so we get the gotcha moment?” =When Mr. Cohen testified before him in February, the most arresting moment came not from the witness but from the congressman himself. “We have got to get back to normal!” Mr. Cummings thundered from the dais in an impassioned eight-minute closing statement that quickly went viral. Elijah Eugene Cummings was born on Jan. 18, 1951, in Baltimore, one of seven children of Robert and Ruth Cummings, and grew up in the city when it was still deeply segregated. His parents were former sharecroppers from South Carolina who had moved north to improve prospects for themselves and their children. Mr. Cummings often spoke of his mother, who, with “only a fourth grade education,” went from doing domestic work to eventually founding her own church, he said. Her humble past had a profound influence on him. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Howard University in Washington, where he was student government president, with a degree in political science. He earned a law degree from the University of Maryland and was a practicing lawyer while serving for 14 years in the Maryland House of Delegates, where he was the first African-American in the state’s history to be named speaker pro tem. Mr. Cummings had been eyeing a seat in the United States Senate, where Democrats were in the minority, when he entered a crowded field in a special election in 1996 to fill the House seat of Kweisi Mfume, who had resigned to become president of the N.A.A.C.P. Mr. Cummings beat more than two dozen other Democrats in a primary, which in heavily Democratic Baltimore is tantamount to winning the general election. He never had a serious challenge after that. In Washington, Mr. Cummings became active in the Congressional Black Caucus and served as its chairman for a time. He mentored other members, like Representative Lacy Clay, who said Mr. Cummings taught him “life lessons” and tutored him on the ways of Congress when he was a freshman. Gun control was a political as well as a personal issue for Mr. Cummings. In June 2011, his nephew Christopher Cummings was shot to death in Virginia, where he was a college student. In 2015, as Baltimore — and his own West Baltimore neighborhood — erupted into riots after the funeral of Freddie Gray, a young black man who had died in police custody, Mr. Cummings took to the streets, bullhorn in hand, to plead for calm. Hours earlier, ever the preachers’ son, he had delivered Mr. Gray’s eulogy. “Did you see him?!” Mr. Cummings roared, his voice rising in anger as he implored the congregation to confront the invisibility of young black men. “Did you see him? Did you see him?” The congregation roared back with applause. Mr. Cummings rose through the ranks of the Oversight Committee to become its top Democrat. In 2019, after Democrats took control of the House, he ascended to the chairmanship, a role that gave him wide latitude. He used his authority broadly, investigating everything from whether Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, had been truthful in explaining why he had added a citizenship question to the 2020 census, to policy matters, like military suicides and the high cost of prescription drugs. (Ms. Pelosi has appointed Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York to be the committee’s acting chairwoman.) The relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cummings got off to a rocky start. In an April 2017 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Trump recounted their first meeting, saying, “Elijah Cummings was in my office, and he said, ‘You will go down as one of the great presidents in the history of our country.’” Mr. Cummings promptly issued a statement saying he had been misquoted. “During my meeting with the president and on several occasions since then,” the statement said, “I have said repeatedly that he could be a great president if — if — he takes steps to truly represent all Americans rather than continuing on the divisive and harmful path he is currently on.” Mr. Cummings became ill that year, prompting his wife to abandon a bid for governor. “He worked until his last breath,” she said in a statement on Thursday, “because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity and that our nation’s diversity was our promise, not our problem.” In addition to his wife, Mr. Cummings’s survivors include two daughters, Jennifer and Adia Cummings, and six siblings: Robert Cummings Jr., Cheretheria Blount, James Cummings, Diane Woodson, Carnel Cummings and Yvonne Cummings Jennings. Mr. Cummings was spiritual in his approach to his illness, and his life. In the May interview, he told the story of how one day, when he was in such dire pain that he thought he might faint, a hospital worker turned up at his bedside, saying the Lord had sent her to deliver a message: “I’m just trying to get your attention. I’m not done with you.” In his final months in the Capitol, Mr. Cummings often sat in his wheelchair by the fireplace in the Speaker’s Lobby, the ornate chamber off the House floor, where he would read quietly or field questions from reporters.

11327,http://thedailybeast.com/inside-youtubes-far-right-radicalization-factory,1,0,,extremism,,,1, Far-Right Radicalization Factory|pulling YouTubers down the rabbit hole of extremism.,,Inside YouTube’s Far-Right Radicalization Factory,"YouTube is a readymade radicalization network for the far right, a new study finds. The Google-owned video platform recently banned conspiracy outlet InfoWars and its founder Alex Jones for hate speech. But another unofficial network of fringe channels is pulling YouTubers down the rabbit hole of extremism, said the Tuesday report from research group Data & Society. The study tracked 65 YouTubers—some of them openly alt-right or white nationalist, others who claim to be simply libertarians, and most of whom have voiced anti-progressive views—as they collaborated across YouTube channels. The result, the study found, is an ecosystem in which a person searching for video game reviews can quickly find themselves watching a four-hour conversation with white nationalist Richard Spencer. Becca Lewis, the researcher behind the report, calls the group the Alternative Influence Network. Its members include racists like Spencer, Gamergate figureheads like Carl Benjamin (who goes by ‘Sargon of Akkad’), and talk-show hosts like Joe Rogan, who promotes guests from fringe ideologies. Not all people in the group express far-right political views themselves, but will platform guests who do. Combined, the 65 YouTubers account for millions of YouTube followers, who can find themselves clicking through a series of increasingly radical-right videos. Take Rogan, a comedian and self-described libertarian whose 3.5 million subscribers recently witnessed him host a bizarre interview with Tesla founder Elon Musk. While Rogan might not express extreme views, his guests often tend to be more fringe. Last year, he hosted Benjamin, the anti-feminist who gained a large following for his harassment campaigns during Gamergate. Rogan’s interview with Benjamin, which has nearly 2 million views, describes Benjamin as an ""Anti-Identitarian liberal YouTuber.” It’s a misleading title for Rogan fans who might go on to view Benjamin’s work. Benjamin, in turn, has also claimed not support the alt-right. Like other less explicitly racist members of the network, he’s hyped his “not racist” cred by promoting livestreamed “debates” (a favorite term in these circles) with white supremacists. But the line between “debate” and collaboration can be indistinct, as Lewis noted in her study. She pointed to one such debate between Benjamin and Spencer, which was moderated by white nationalist creep Jean-Francois Gariepy, and which briefly became the world’s top trending live video on YouTube, with more than 10,000 live viewers. “In his video with [Richard] Spencer, Benjamin was presumably debating against scientific racism, a stance he frequently echoes,” Lewis wrote in her study. “However, by participating in the debate, he was building a shared audience—and thus, a symbiotic relationship— with white nationalists. In fact, Benjamin has become a frequent guest on channels that host such ‘debates,’ which often function as group entertainment as much as genuine disagreements.” Debates are often better measures of rhetorical skill than they are of an idea’s merits. A well-spoken idiot might stand a good chance against a shy expert in a televised argument. When they disagreed during the four-hour livestream, Spencer, a more practiced speaker, mopped the floor with Benjamin. The debate earned Spencer new followers, some of whom appear to have been lured in by the other YouTubers’ thinly-disguised bigotry. “I’ve never really listened to Spencer speak before,” one commenter wrote. “But it is immediately apparent that he’s on a whole different level.” And Benjamin has been willing to collaborate with further-right far right YouTubers when the circumstances benefited him. “In many ways, we do have similar objectives,” he told the openly racist YouTuber Millennial Woes in one video cited in the study. “We have the same enemies, right? I mean, you guys hate the SJWs, I hate the SJWs. I want to see the complete destruction of social justice. . . . If the alt-right took the place of the SJWs, I would have a lot less to fear.” “Some of the more mainstream conservatives or libertarians are able to have it both ways,” Lewis told The Daily Beast on Tuesday. “They can say they reject the alt-right … but at the same time, there’s a lot of nudging and winking.” Her report cited other instances of this phenomenon, including self-identified “classical liberal” YouTuber Dave Rubin, who promotes anti-progressive views on his talk show, where he hosts more extreme personalities, ostensibly for debate. But the debates can skew friendly. The study pointed to a conversation in which Rubin allowed far-right YouTuber Stefan Molyneux to make junk science claims unchecked. A description for the video encouraged viewers to do their own research, but provided links to Molyneux’s own content. “It gives a generally unchallenged platform for that white nationalist and their ideas,” Lewis said on Tuesday. YouTube’s algorithms can sometimes reward fringe content. Researcher Zeynep Tufekci previously highlighted the phenomenon when she noted that, after she watched footage of Donald Trump rallies, YouTube began recommending an increasingly radical series of white supremacist and conspiracy videos. Lewis said YouTubers have learned to leverage the site’s algorithms, frontloading their videos with terms like “liberal” and “intersectional” in a bid to “hijack” search results that would typically be dominated by the left. YouTube, which is built to keep users watching videos, might be a perfect recruiting platform for fringe movements, which want followers to remain similarly engaged. “One way scholars of social movements often talk about recruitment is in terms of the capacity of the movement to bring in new recruits and then retain them,” Joan Donovan, a research lead at Data & Society said on Tuesday.“Social media is optimized for engagement, which is both recruitment of an audience and retention of that audience. These groups often use the tools of analytics to make sure they continue to grow their networks.”",CR,,0,||,1,"A new report reveals how an unofficial network of fringe channels is pulling YouTubers down the rabbit hole of extremism|Rogan’s interview with Benjamin, which has nearly 2 million views, describes Benjamin as an ""Anti-Identitarian liberal YouTuber.”|Inside YouTube’s Far-Right Radicalization Factory",1,"Inside YouTube’s Far-Right Radicalization Factory|A new report reveals how an unofficial network of fringe channels is pulling YouTubers down the rabbit hole of extremism.|Combined, the 65 YouTubers account for millions of YouTube followers, who can find themselves clicking through a series of increasingly radical-right videos."

Pelosi and her deputies have signaled they'll work quickly to depose key players in the Ukraine scandal, hoping for swift proceedings that won't spill into the 2020 election year. But Trump has been slow to cobble together a response, convinced he has no need for a separate impeachment team and confident in his own ability to counter-message Democrats, multiple sources close to the White House told CNN. Six days after Pelosi's announcement, there is now a growing concern among the President's allies that he doesn't understand the implications of what lies ahead or how quickly it's moving. Trump spent the weekend on the phone with aides and allies, railing against the whistleblower and those who provided the person with information related to his phone calls with foreign leaders, according to people familiar with the conversations. He also waged battle on Twitter, calling for the outing of the whistleblower, demanding the House intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff be questioned for treason after he read a fictionalized version of the President's call with Zelensky and accusing officials who provided the whistleblower with information of spying. Aside from the fervent tweeting, there were signs the White House would rely on its allies in Congress to defend the President as the impeachment inquiry heats up. Yet the limits of that plan were apparent Sunday, as Republican lawmakers struggled to justify what Trump said to his Ukrainian counterpart during a July phone call. A whistleblower complaint alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine on that call in the upcoming 2020 election, and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied doing anything improper, despite a transcript released by the White House showing he repeatedly pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden -- his potential 2020 political rival -- and his son, Hunter Biden. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. In interviews on Sunday talk shows, top GOP allies of the President repeated White House talking points -- or in the case of Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, appeared to be reading directly from a prepared script. In an appearance on CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy was challenged for regurgitating White House talking points, though he denied having received them. Rep. Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, and CNN's Jake Tapper got into a contentious exchange Sunday on ""State of the Union"" after the lawmaker made false and misleading claims about the unfolding Ukraine drama. The Sunday appearances did little to quell the furor around Trump's behavior. While they were in front of cameras without a strong rebuttal, Trump privately resisted appeals for help. He has dismissed talks of forming an impeachment response team, raging that talk of bringing former aides back to help him projected weakness. Last week, some of Trump's allies raised bringing in his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to spearhead a response team. The two men never discussed the idea directly, and talks fell apart after Trump grew angry that the discussions became public. White House aides now say it doesn't appear likely to happen. And he has privately declared he doesn't need any more lawyers, even though several people have privately told him that his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, isn't helping him. Other outside attorneys who defended Trump during special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, including Jay Sekulow, have switched to working on impeachment. Despite Trump's resistance, at least one administration official conceded it was likely additional lawyers would be needed. A Republican congressional aide said there is a sense on Capitol Hill that things are heading in a bad direction for Trump. ""We are entering a phase with a lot of unknowns. People are anxious about what else is out there,"" the aide said about the growing feeling among Republican staffers and lawmakers. No war room Sekulow said last week that no impeachment war room at the White House is being set up. The President met Friday with White House lawyers and his personal counsel to discuss a strategy for dealing with the Democrats' impeachment investigation. Aides were expected to further brief Trump on plans for an impeachment response sometime this week, according to administration officials, though some inside the White House view the past six days as a lost opportunity to shape public opinion at the outset of the inquiry. Trump has sought to control the message himself on Twitter, mainly in angry bursts fueled by conservative media. The fuming has caused some fractures within the Republican Party -- a problem for the White House, which has largely relied on Republicans in Congress and outside the administration to defend Trump, instead of internal administration officials. GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, responding to Trump's tweet quoting a pastor warning of a ""Civil War like fracture,"" wrote that language was ""beyond repugnant."" ""I have visited nations ravaged by civil war,"" he wrote. ""I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President."" Trump's behavior throughout the controversy has frustrated top officials in the West Wing because the President will not give up on his conspiracy theories about the 2016 election that can be found in the rough transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky. Trump's first homeland security adviser Tom Bossert, who was pushed out when John Bolton arrived as national security adviser, was the first former official to break with Trump on the nature of his call with Zelensky, saying he was ""deeply disturbed"" by the matter but cautioned that it was ""far from proven"" whether the President threatened to withhold military aid over it. Still, Bossert painted a portrait of a President consumed by ""debunked"" conspiracy theories about Ukraine, warned over and over they were wrong, and still intent on pursuing them. ""At this point I am deeply frustrated with what he and the legal team is doing and repeating that debunked theory to the President. It sticks in his mind when he hears it over and over again,"" Bossert said on ABC's ""This Week."" Giuliani effect Bossert's frustration with Giuliani reflects growing anger in Trump's orbit at the former New York City mayor, who operated outside the confines of the administration to pursue Ukrainian officials and convince them to investigate the Bidens. Trump has stood back as Giuliani has entangled the secretary of state and other administration officials in the scandal, asserting Mike Pompeo had a hand in his Ukrainian outreach. ""I did not do this on my own,"" Giuliani said on CBS Sunday. ""I did it at the request of the State Department, and I have all of the text messages to prove it. And I also have a thank you from them from doing a good job. When I talked to the secretary last week, he said he was aware of it."" Despite deep frustration inside the White House over his doings, Giuliani has been the mainstay defending Trump on television. This is, in part, on purpose, two people close to the matter said. Because Giuliani is seen as someone who can't be controlled by anyone other than Trump, officials have decided to sit back and let him go on television until he burns himself out. Then, these people said, the President's allies who are better equipped will step in. The question is whether it will be too late by then.",CR,,0,||,1,"He also waged battle on Twitter, calling for the outing of the whistleblower, demanding the House intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff be questioned for treason after he read a fictionalized version of the President's call with Zelensky and accusing officials who provided the whistleblower with information of spying.|A whistleblower complaint alleges Trump abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine on that call in the upcoming 2020 election, and that the White House took steps to cover it up.|GOP Rep.

Elijah Cummings, key figure in Trump investigations, dies at 68","Washington (CNN)Rep. Elijah Cummings, a longtime Maryland Democrat and key figure leading investigations into President Donald Trump, has died at age 68, his office announced early Thursday morning. He died of ""complications concerning longstanding health challenges,"" his office said in a statement. The congressman, who had represented Maryland's 7th Congressional District since 1996, served as the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, one of the panels involved in the impeachment inquiry of Trump. He oversaw a range of investigations into the Trump administration, from issues relating to the impeachment inquiry to the treatment of migrants at the southern border to the use of personal email for official use by White House officials to how a citizenship question was considered for the US census. And it was his committee that grilled Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, in a blockbuster hearing this past February. It was not immediately clear who will succeed Cummings as chairman of the Oversight Committee or how his passing will affect the swirling impeachment investigation into Trump. The House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee will nominate a new chairman to fill the vacancy before the full House votes to confirm the pick. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will have a major say on who the next chair will be. A senior Democratic leadership aide said Thursday that Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York ""becomes Acting Chair as number two in seniority on the committee. The caucus process to elect a permanent Chair will be announced at a later time."" Cummings had been in failing health in recent weeks. He had been in and out of the hospital, missing votes and business in his committee. He was spotted several times with a breathing tube in his nose connected to oxygen while sitting on the House floor. When speaking to reporters, he would have to wait for 15 to 20 seconds or so to catch his breath before speaking. He would drive around on a motorized wheelchair through the Capitol and then walk in using a walker. Although he was chairman of the Oversight Committee, he had not been in command of the investigations on his panel. His staff did a lion's share of the work and his staff has been helping lead the charge in the impeachment inquiry. Still, Cummings' death left a noticeable impact on lawmakers from both parties on Capitol Hill Thursday morning. Pelosi appeared visibly emotional as she started her weekly press conference. ""In the Congress, Elijah was considered a north star,"" Pelosi said, referring to Cummings as ""my brother in Baltimore."" ""He was a leader of towering character and integrity. He lived the American dream. "" Pelosi said that Cummings ""spoke with unsurpassed clarity and moral integrity,"" adding ""everyone wanted to hear what Elijah had to say. That was the case in Congress, in his committee and in the country."" Prominent Trump critic As he has led the investigative efforts, Cummings also clashed publicly with the President. Over the summer, Trump tweeted disparaging remarks toward Cummings and his Maryland district, which includes much of Baltimore, calling the majority black district a ""disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess."" Responding to some of the President's tweets -- in which Trump suggested the congressman needed to spend more time fixing his district -- Cummings said on Twitter: ""Mr. President, I go home to my district daily. Each morning, I wake up, and I go and fight for my neighbors. It is my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the Executive Branch. But, it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents."" Trump's first reaction to Cummings' death came in a tweet Thursday morning in which he wished his ""warmest condolences."" ""I got to see first hand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard, if not impossible, to replace!"" Trump tweeted. Trump and Cummings did not always disagree. More than two years ago, Cummings emerged from a White House meeting with Trump and told reporters that the two men had found common ground on their shared interest in lowering drug prices. At the time, Cummings also said he urged the President to rethink his language on African American communities after Trump repeatedly painted a grim picture of inner-city life on the campaign trail. ""I want you to realize that all African American communities are not places of depression and where people are being harmed,"" Cummings told reporters, recalling his conversation with Trump. ""When we hear those words about carnage and we are living in depressed situations, I told him it was very hurtful."" In her news conference Thursday, Pelosi mentioned that the House Democrats were considering naming legislation aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs, a proposal currently being discussed in the chamber, for Cummings, given his advocacy on the issue. Friendship with other Republicans Despite being an outspoken and passionate defender of Democratic causes in Congress, Cummings fostered strong relationship with Republicans across Capitol Hill. In one high-profile moment earlier this year, Cummings stood up for Republican Rep. Mark Meadows, one of the President's closest allies and staunchest defenders in Congress, in the face of accusations of racism. The chairman referred to Meadows as one of his ""best friends."" When Meadows learned of Cummings' passing Thursday, he said he was ""truly heartbroken."" ""I have no other words to express the loss,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top ranking Republican on Cummings' committee, said the Maryland Democrat ""injected an unyielding passion and purpose into his work on the Committee."" ""Our thoughts are also with his staff, who are among the hardest working people on Capitol Hill,"" Jordan said in a statement. ""Their loyalty and affinity for him speaks volumes about his character."" Former Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, who regularly sparred with Cummings on the polarizing House's committee investigating Benghazi several years ago, said Cummings was ""one of the most powerful, beautiful & compelling voices in American politics."" ""We never had a cross word outside of a committee room,"" Gowdy wrote in a series of tweets on Cummings. ""He had a unique ability to separate the personal from the work. The story of Elijah's life would benefit everyone, regardless of political ideation."" Leading African American voice on Capitol Hill Cummings, who grew up during the Civil Rights Movement, had become a leading voice among African American lawmakers on Capitol Hill at the time of his passing, and his death triggered an outpouring of grief from his colleagues. ""He spoke truth to power, defended the disenfranchised and represented West Baltimore with strength and dignity,"" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, House Democratic caucus chairman and a fellow member of the Congressional Black Caucus, tweeted Thursday morning. ""Congress has lost a Champion. Heaven has gained an Angel of Justice. May he forever #RestInPower."" House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler called Cummings a ""giant of public service,"" and Sen. Ben Cardin said his fellow Marylander ""guaranteed a voice to so many who would otherwise not have one."" Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz told CNN's John Berman on ""New Day"" that Cummings was ""a mentor and someone who in every situation would do the right thing, would put his community and the cause above everything else. Including himself."" The Florida Democrat said watching Cummings continue with his duties despite his health struggles was inspirational. ""We'll walk in his shadow, in his shoes that will never be filled,"" she said. Veteran of Civil Rights Movement Earlier this year, Cummings discussed how, even at a young age, he faced racial violence in trying to integrate parts of his neighborhood. ""We were trying to integrate an Olympic-size pool near my house, and we had been constrained to a wading pool in the black community,"" Cummings told ABC's ""This Week"" in July. ""As we tried to march to that pool over six days, I was beaten, all kinds of rocks and bottles thrown at me."" Cummings said Trump's racist remarks against four minority members of Congress echoed the same insults he heard as a 12-year-old boy in 1962, which he said were ""very painful."" ""The interesting thing is that I heard the same chants. 'Go home. You don't belong here,' "" he told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos. ""And they called us the N-word over and over again."" Cummings was born and raised in Baltimore -- the city that is home to his district. The son of former sharecroppers, Cummings was born in 1951 and graduated from Baltimore City College High School in 1969. He practiced law and served for 14 years in the Maryland House of Delegates, where, according to his congressional website, he became the first African American in Maryland history to be named Speaker Pro Tem. In 1996, he was first elected to the US Congress. Cummings was reelected last year in the 7th Congressional District with 76% of the vote.

He curses, insists the questions aren’t relevant and sometimes slams down the phone. Mostly, he defends his older brother, Jeffrey Epstein, insisting he wasn’t a sex trafficker at all. “He was innocent and, until proven guilty, you are entitled to bail in America,’’ said Mark Epstein, Jeffrey Epstein’s only sibling, next of kin and likely heir to his brother’s estimated $500 million fortune. Mark Epstein is talking, but only because he believes that his 66-year-old brother was killed, and he is challenging both the Department of Justice and New York City’s chief medical examiner. He insists the pathologist erred in concluding that his brother hanged himself in August at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center. “I could see if he got a life sentence, I could then see him taking himself out, but he had a bail hearing coming up,’’ said Epstein, a real estate mogul who says he knows very little about his late brother’s businesses — or his brother’s alleged sex crimes against underage girls and young women. Mark Epstein, 65, lives in New York, where he grew up with his brother and parents in Brooklyn. He says at the time of his brother’s death, on Aug. 10, he had not seen him in seven years, and did not speak to him often.“Jeffrey and I were not that close, we shared brother stuff, but I was not involved in what he was doing. When he first got in trouble he called me. We were very straight with each other. I wasn’t going to lecture him.’’ Jeffrey Epstein was first arrested in Palm Beach, Florida, in 2006. A multimillionaire whose exact source of wealth remains a mystery, Jeffrey cultivated friendships with powerful and elite scientists, politicians, CEOs, celebrities, academics and philanthropists — as well as former and current presidents, such as Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. In 2008, Epstein received an extraordinarily lenient federal non-prosecution agreement that allowed him to plead guilty to minor prostitution charges. Under the deal, negotiated by former Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, he received federal immunity on sex trafficking charges, and agreed to serve 13 months in the Palm Beach County jail. He spent very little time in his jail cell, as he was granted a liberal work release arrangement by the Palm Beach County sheriff. Epstein’s private valet picked him up nearly every day and took him to his downtown West Palm Beach office. Mark says after his brother was released from jail in 2009, he reformed himself. Mark says to his knowledge, his brother didn’t do anything illegal with other girls or women after that time. He points out that most of the women coming forward with allegations post-2009 were women who were 18 or older. “Do I think that it was inappropriate for him, at age 50 or 60 to be with women who were 18 or 20? Yes, but it certainly wasn’t illegal and it wasn’t sex trafficking,’’ Epstein says. FUELING ALTERNATIVE THEORIES On Aug. 11, not quite 24 hours after Jeffrey Epstein’s death, Mark Epstein hired one of the world’s most famous forensic pathologists, Dr. Michael Baden, to observe his brother’s autopsy. Baden, 85, and another noted forensic pathologist who reviewed Baden’s findings, Dr. Cyril Wecht, 88, have both concluded that Jeffrey Epstein’s injuries were more consistent with manual strangulation than hanging. Their opinions, combined with the fact that New York City Medical Examiner Barbara Sampson has not released a full report on the investigation, have fueled widespread conspiracy theories that began almost immediately after Epstein was found in his cell, allegedly on his knees, with a sheet fashioned into a ligature around his neck, about 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 10. Baden said Epstein had been dead for several hours, and his body should have not been moved. Emergency personnel however, transported him from the federal jail in downtown Manhattan to the hospital, Baden said. Baden was present at the autopsy, which was conducted the next day by medical examiner Kristin Roman. Both he and Roman agreed that the cause and manner of death were not clear, so she designated it pending further investigation, Baden saidBut just five days later, on Aug. 16, Sampson changed the cause of death to suicide by hanging. Epstein had three fractures on the left and right side of his larynx, Baden said, and the chance of someone breaking three bones in their neck as a result of a low-velocity self-inflicted hanging, while not unheard of, is rare.While damage to that bone is more common in cases of strangulation, medical experts have also said it is more easily damaged in older people like Epstein. Sampson, who did not respond to the Miami Herald’s request for comment, has stood by her findings. Both Baden and Wecht say that the medical examiner should not have changed the cause of death until after the death had been fully investigated. Like all prison deaths, especially a high-profile one, it should have been treated, for investigative purposes, as a possible homicide from the start.“Once you decide that it’s a suicide, you don’t do the same kind of evidence collection that you would if you considered it a suspicious death,’’ Baden said. “It is amazing how much information you can get by interviewing the prisoners in the nearby cell. Would the FBI have interviewed them if they thought it was a suicide?” Mark Epstein, while not providing details, believes that there were people who wanted his brother dead, and he is concerned that his own life, and the lives of other people, may be in jeopardy because federal authorities have not fully probed the circumstances under which his brother died. “Jeffrey knew a lot of stuff about a lot of people,’’ Mark Epstein said. WALL STREET AS ‘WILD WEST’ Jeffrey Epstein began cultivating important clients as a trader on Wall Street, his brother said. He said his brother was a math whiz while growing up in Brooklyn and was accepted to and attended Cooper Union, the renowned New York art, architecture and engineering school where Mark, also a Cooper Union alum, would later serve a rocky tenure as chairman of the board of trustees.“People are calling Jeffrey a college dropout and make him out to be a really bad character. But my brother went to Cooper Union and it’s hard to get in there. He didn’t drop out. He didn’t need a degree, he was really good at math and he didn’t let not having a degree hold him back.’’ Because Cooper Union did not have a mathematics major, Mark said his brother applied to and was accepted into New York University’s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. But ultimately Jeffrey accepted a low-level floor trader job with Bear Stearns, and decided to apply his mathematical skills to the options market. “He got involved with Wall Street when it was the Wild West,’’ Mark Epstein said. “When we were young men he came home one day and he said that if the general public knew what was taking place on Wall Street, there would be a revolution. People would be appalled at how corrupt it was.’’ Jeffrey Epstein did leave Bear Stearns, abruptly, causing speculation that he had been under investigation for a securities violation. Their parents, Seymour and Pauline, were married in 1952 and remained together until his father’s death in 1991 at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, where he was undergoing treatment for a heart condition, Mark said. Mark said they were both close to their father, a laborer and maintenance worker for the New York City Parks Department, and to their mother, who worked as a secretary for an insurance company.“We grew up in a close family,’’ Epstein said. But in later years, he said, he and his brother’s paths went in different directions. “He was in the financial world and I was more involved in the artist community,’’ Epstein said. Mark Epstein refused to talk about his art ties, but he once owned a silk-screening business before going into real estate. Mark’s real estate company, Ossa Properties, owns a majority stake in an apartment high-rise at 301 E. 66th St. in New York. Court records show that Jeffrey Epstein often housed women in the building, although Mark has previously denied having any business connections to his brother. Mark acknowledged that he put up his Florida condo as collateral to help with his brother’s bail after Jeffrey was arrested in July on sex trafficking charges, months after the Miami Herald published a series of stories, Perversion of Justice, that highlighted his abuse of underage girls and efforts by Acosta — then the U.S. attorney, later President Trump’s labor secretary — to keep victims unaware of the pending plea deal. The July charges, brought by Geoffrey Berman, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, alleged that Jeffrey Epstein was operating an illegal sex operation in New York and Florida for decades. A judge denied Epstein’s $77 million bail proposal on July 17, but Jeffrey Epstein and his lawyers were appealing the decision at the time of his death. “He had a bail hearing in two days. He agreed to be on house arrest. He was going to hire armed guards to keep an eye on him at his own expense. … He was the most recognizable person on the planet. Where is he going to run and hide?” Mark Epstein said. ‘CONSPIRACY NONSENSE’ On Aug. 10 — the same day Epstein’s body was found — U.S. Attorney General William Barr announced that Epstein had died that morning of “an apparent suicide,’’ and called for investigations into his death. “You never announce the results first,’’ said Glenn Kirschner, a former federal prosecutor and frequent Barr critic. “It’s very hard to contradict what the most powerful law enforcement officer in our country has announced to the American people. It appears that he just wanted to shut down this and to cover up what Epstein knew about some very rich and influential people.’’ The Justice Department is probing the death, but Epstein’s brother said there’s no indication that they are probing the cause and manner of his death. FBI investigators, for example, haven’t questioned Epstein’s former cellmate, Nick Tartaglione, an ex-New York cop awaiting trial, accused of four murders. Mark said that his brother claimed that Tartaglione had assaulted him. “This is all conspiracy nonsense,’’ said Bruce A. Barket, Tartaglione’s attorney. Tartaglione, awaiting a death-penalty trial, was cleared of wrongdoing in the alleged jail attack, Barket said. But the details of the incident have not been made public by the Bureau of Prisons, nor has the report on Epstein’s injuries from that incident been given to Baden for review. Barket adamantly denies there is anything suspicious about Epstein’s death, and has no doubt that the disgraced financier committed suicide. But he concedes that it’s baffling that his client still hasn’t been questioned by the FBI. “I don’t know how they did a thorough investigation when they haven’t interviewed my client,’’ Barket said. Baden and Wecht —professional friends who, at times, have been on opposing sides of a death investigation — agree that there are too many coincidences surrounding Epstein’s death that haven’t been examined. “Epstein was accused of crimes of a heinous nature, that anyone — even the most hardened criminals — would be repulsed and angry about,’’ Wecht said. Child predators are usually prime targets in prisons, just by the nature of their crimes, he said. “So what do they do, they give him a cellmate who happens to be over 200 pounds, a former cop. Then we are led to believe that on July 23 he had a ‘suicide attempt,’ when he is found unconscious, and so they move him to suicide watch. Then they let him off the watch, then they move his cellmate, then the camera doesn’t work, then the guards fall asleep, then they cut him down and they move him before the medical examiner came, and they know full well not to do that.“Remember this is not a one-cell cockamamie prison, this is a federal prison in downtown New York City that housed John Gotti and El Chapo [the drug Mexico lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman]. To accept all these as facts is unbelievable.’’ Baden said the only piece of evidence they have seen of the death scene is a photograph, presumably taken by prison officials, of the cell after Epstein was removed. “Everything we have is from two guards, who immediately lawyered up and refused to say anything. We have one photograph that shows the ligature laid out on the ground, which, if that’s the way it was found, it looks like it was a planted kind of scene because that’s not the way it would have been found if the guards had cut it.’’ Wecht said the photo also shows that the top bunk was being used to store toiletries, and the items didn’t appear to be touched. If Epstein had tied the ligature to the top bunk and leaped or pulled himself with enough strength to break three bones in his neck, then the toiletries on the bunk would have been in disarray. “I have never seen this kind of hanging scenario, this leaning forward, with three fractures. The bunk was three to four feet above, and there was not enough velocity there to produce three fractures,’’ Wecht said. Mark Epstein said he is awaiting further documents they’ve requested from the medical examiner, the paramedics and the Bureau of Prisons. “It’s all very suspicious, too much to be a coincidence.’’",VC,,0,,0,,0,

Ten of the 13 bishops elevated to the high rank are under the age of 80 and so are eligible to vote in a conclave to elect a new pope from their ranks. Francis has now appointed more than half of the 128 cardinal electors, increasing the possibility that the next pope will continue his progressive policies. Over six years he has appointed more cardinal electors than those still alive who were named by former Pope Benedict and the late Pope John Paul combined. At a ceremony in St. Peter’s Basilica, known as consistory, Francis gave the new cardinals their trademark red biretta, or hat, and asked them to always be compassionate with others and loyal. The geographical distribution of the new cardinal electors reflects Francis’s desire to give more clout to small national churches outside of Europe and North America, countries on the periphery of world political power. Nearly 50% of the cardinal electors now come from the developing world. “I think that the pope wanted to make visible the churches that were almost invisible,” said Cardinal Cristobal Lopez Romero, of Rabat, the capital of Morocco, which is overwhelmingly Muslim. Romero, 67, is one of four new cardinal electors who are steeped in experience with Islam. The others are Cardinal Miguel Angel Ayuso Guixot, 67, the Spanish head of the Vatican’s department for inter-religious dialogue; British Cardinal Michael Fitzgerald, 82, one of the Church’s foremost experts on Islam and the Koran, and Cardinal Ignatius Suharyo Hardjoatmodjo, 69, the archbishop of Jakarta in Indonesia, the country with the world’s largest Moslem population. Clerics who have fought for social justice and defended the rights of the poor and immigrants were also prominent among the new cardinals. Cardinal Alvaro Leonel Ramazzini Imperia, 72, of Guatemala has helped farmers there buy their land to grow coffee, led campaigns against pollution caused by mining, and stood up to multinational corporations. Cardinal Michael Czerny, 73, a Canadian who was born in the former Czechoslovakia, has worked with the poor in El Salvador and Kenya and is currently is the Vatican’s expert on migration, a choice reflecting Francis’ own strong defense of immigrants. Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerith, 61, of Luxembourg has taken a strong stand against Europe’s populist leaders, saying this year that they were playing an “ignoble game” by creating fear of migrants and Muslims. Italy’s Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, 63, archbishop of Bologna, hails from the progressive Rome-based Santo’ Egidio Community, which helps the poor, migrants, homeless and refugees around the world. Cardinal Frivolling Ambo Besungu, 59, archbishop of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo, stood up to former president Joseph Kabila when he delayed elections and also defended Catholics who took part in pro-democracy demonstrations. Cardinal Sights Tamkevicius, 81, of Lithuania, spent six months in prison and more than five years in exile in Siberia for his defense of religious freedom during the Soviet era. Cardinal Juan de la Caridad Garcia Rodriguez, 71, of Cuba, helped get priests to minister to prisoners on the communist-run island after the government began permitting them in the late 1980s.",CR,,0,||,0,||,0,||

On its two-year anniversary, Twitter users are copying and pasting the tweet in solidarity against antisemitism. Zipporah Arielle (@coffeespoonie), a 26-year-old disability activist whose grandparents were Holocaust survivors, was temporarily banned from Twitter for sharing her thoughts in 2017. On Sunday, she reflected on the tweet and reiterated her opinion on evildoers. “I somehow missed the two year anniversary of the greatest tweet I ever wrote!! I can’t repost it because Twitter already suspended me for it once and they’ll do it again BUT just because someone is human doesn’t mean that someone isn’t evil,” she tweeted. In the original tweet, Arielle argued that despite being humans with aspirations and even intimate personal lives, Nazis are ultimately evil and “deserve to be shot.” “Nazis are people. Nazis are human beings. They were young once. They have parents. Many are parents, or will be. They have dreams. They have feelings. They have human bodies. They sleep. They get sick. They age. And they still deserve to be shot. That’s very fucking important,” she wrote. Arielle explained that the infamous tweet was created as a result of “Nazi sympathy” in 2017, when she believed antisemitism was particularly high. She shared a video of a Nazi being punched in the face, calling it funny, and was reprimanded online as a result. “Some people responded by saying it wasn’t funny because Nazis are bad, but they’re still people… basically, messages of sympathy for the Nazi (while ignoring those negatively impacted by his Nazism),” Arielle told the Daily Dot via Twitter message. But far-right Twitter users caught wind of her tweet and reported her account to Twitter, among other tactics to harass her. “They did a lot to try and silence me, by threatening me and my loved ones with murder, rape, harassment, assault and battery, and more,” Arielle said. “If I searched my name, I found myself all over forums like 4chan with comment after comment insulting me for being Jewish, disabled, a woman, etc.; I was sent endless hate mail online including images of me [Photoshopped] to appear as if I was in an oven, or a gas chamber, or being sexually assaulted by Hitler.” After being swarmed with mass-reporting, both Twitter and Paypal suspended her accounts. But amid the attacks, “there was also an equal and opposite positive backlash,” Arielle said. Supporters on social media continued to spread her message by reposting her tweet in solidarity. Eventually, her Twitter account was reopened. Even though she has refrained from retweeting the post on its two-year anniversary (out of fear that Twitter will suspend her again), others are sharing the original text. “Their goal was to silence me, but I will never be silenced,” Arielle said. “I will never stop speaking up for what I know is right, and I will never stop speaking out against naziism, racism, antisemitism, fascism, and hatred in all forms.”",CR,,0,||,1,"I can’t repost it because Twitter already suspended me for it once and they’ll do it again BUT just because someone is human doesn’t mean that someone isn’t evil,” she tweeted.|In the original tweet, Arielle argued that despite being humans with aspirations and even intimate personal lives, Nazis are ultimately evil and “deserve to be shot.”|“Nazis are people.

Even the White House’s memorandum of the phone conversation President Trump had with the Ukrainian president in July makes it clear that Mr. Trump asked a foreign country to help him undermine a political rival. But while national polls show support for impeaching him is growing, it’s still divided sharply along partisan lines. Democrats strongly favor it, while Republicans tend to oppose it. I’ve been following this story from my little corner of the world in rural Van Buren County, Ark. Tim Widener, 50, who lives outside my hometown, Clinton, summed up the town’s attitude well: “It’s really a sad waste of taxpayers’ money,” he told me. Mr. Widener could have been talking about anything. His comment reflected a worldview that is becoming ever more deeply ingrained in the white people who remain in rural America — Washington politicians are spending money that they shouldn’t be. In 2016, shortly after Mr. Trump’s victory, Katherine J. Cramer, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, summed up the attitudes she observed after years of studying rural Americans: “The way these folks described the world to me, their basic concern was that people like them, in places like theirs, were overlooked and disrespected,” she wrote in Vox, explaining that her subjects considered “racial minorities on welfare” as well as “lazy urban professionals” working desk jobs to be undeserving of state and federal dollars. People like my neighbors hate that the government is spending money on those who don’t look like them and don’t live like them — but what I’ve learned since I came home is that they remain opposed even when they themselves stand to benefit. I returned to Van Buren County at the end of 2017 after 20 years living on the East Coast, most recently in the Washington area, because I’m writing a book about Clinton, Van Buren’s county seat. My partner and I knew it would be a challenge: The county is very remote, very religious and full of Trump voters, and we suspected we’d stand out because of our political beliefs. Since coming back, I’ve realized that it is true that people here think life here has taken a turn for the worse. What’s also true, though, is that many here seem determined to get rid of the last institutions trying to help them, to keep people with educations out, and to retreat from community life and concentrate on taking care of themselves and their own families. It’s an attitude that is against taxes, immigrants and government, but also against helping your neighbor. Most Americans live in cities, but our political system gives rural areas like Van Buren outsize voting power. My time here makes me believe that the impeachment scandal will not hurt Mr. Trump — and that Democrats who promise to make the lives of people like my neighbors better might actually help him. I realized this after a fight over, of all things, our local library. In April, a local man who operates the Facebook group, “Van Buren County Today Unfiltered,” posted the agenda for a coming meeting of the Quorum Court, the county’s governing body. The library board wanted to increase the pay it could offer a new head librarian, who would be combining her new job with an older one, to $25 an hour. ‘His Body Doesn’t Belong to Me’ Only about 2,500 people live in my hometown. The library serves the entire county, which has an estimated 16,600 people, a marked decline from the population at the last census in 2010. The library has historically provided a variety of services for this community. It has offered summer reading camps for children and services like high-speed internet, sewing classes and academic help. I grew up going to the library and visited it often when I returned. It was always busy. I thought people would be supportive. Instead, they started a fight. The battle began on the Facebook post, which had 240 comments by the end. The first comment came from Amie Hamilton, who reiterated her point when I interviewed her several months later. “If you want to make $25 an hour, please go to a city that can afford it,” she wrote. “We the people are not here to pay your excessive salaries through taxation or in any other way.” There was general agreement among the Facebook commenters that no one in the area was paid that much — the librarian’s wages would have worked out to be about $42,200 a year — and the people who do actually earn incomes that are similar — teachers and many county officials — largely remained quiet. (Clinton has a median income of $34,764 and a poverty rate of 22.6 percent.) When a few of us, including me, pointed out that the candidate for the library job had a master’s degree, more people commented on the uselessness of education. “Call me narrow-minded but I’ve never understood why a librarian needs a four-year degree,” someone wrote. “We were taught Dewey decimal system in grade school. Never sounded like anything too tough.” I watched the fight unfold with a sense of sadness, anger and frustration. I started arguing. It didn’t work. The pay request was pulled from the Quorum Court’s agenda. I didn’t realize it at first, but the fight over the library was rolled up into a bigger one about the library building, and an even bigger fight than that, about the county government, what it should pay for, and how and whether people should be taxed at all. The library fight was, itself, a fight over the future of rural America, what it meant to choose to live in a county like mine, what my neighbors were willing to do for one another, what they were willing to sacrifice to foster a sense of community here. The answer was, for the most part, not very much. A 2016 analysis by National Public Radio found that as counties become more rural, they tend to become more Republican. Completely rural counties went for Mr. Trump by 70.6 percent over all, which makes my county politically average — Van Buren gave Mr. Trump 73 percent of its vote. Rural America is not a monolith, but a majority of rural counties fit perfectly into Mr. Trump’s preferred demographics: They are largely white (96.2 percent in Van Buren), and rates of educational attainment are low. People are leaving rural areas for cities because that’s where the jobs are. According to one analysis, between 2008, during the Great Recession, and 2017, the latest year for which data is available, 99 percent of the job and population growth occurred in counties with at least one city of 50,000 people or more or in counties directly adjacent to such cities. It’s hard to generalize what’s happening to rural counties, but many are faced with a shrinking property tax base and a drop in economic activity, which also decreases sales tax revenues. Many rural counties are also experiencing declines in whatever industries were once the major employers. In Appalachia, this is coal; in much of the Midwest, it is heavy manufacturing; and in my county, and many other counties, it’s natural gas and other extractive industries. This part of Arkansas sits on the Fayetteville Shale, which brought in natural gas exploration in the early 2000s. For about a decade, the gas companies paid local taxes on their property, equipment and the money they made from extracting natural gas, and landowners paid property taxes on the royalties they earned. It was a boom. Many people at the time, here and elsewhere, expected that the money would last longer than it did. Instead, the price of natural gas plummeted in 2009 and profits declined. Production slowed. One of the biggest natural gas companies in the area, Houston-based Southwestern Energy, stopped paying taxes to the counties here, arguing that the rates were unfair. The company and five Arkansas counties, including mine, are still locked in litigation over some of the money it owes (it recently paid a portion of it). Van Buren’s County’s chief executive, Dale James, told me that county revenues had declined by at least 20 percent from when gas production was at its height in 2008. The county budget is now just over $11 million, including revenue from local taxes and state and federal grants. When local economies are flagging, state governments don’t step in to help as much as they once did. The Pew Charitable Trust found that state aid to local governments fell by 5.3 percent during the recession’s lowest point, in fiscal year 2013, and it still is below what it was before the recession. On top of that, 45 states restrict the way local governments can collect property taxes on their citizens in some way: In Arkansas, property and sales tax increases, the main source of revenue for many local governments, have to be approved by voters. It means many county governments are getting less money on several fronts. A report from the National Association of Counties from 2016 was titled, “Doing More With Less.” It’s the new normal. Local budgets pay for the infrastructure and institutions people deal with every day — schools, roads, water, trash collection, libraries and animal shelters. Cuts to those services are felt in a visceral way. The fight over the pay for the new head librarian had a larger context: The library moved into a new building, with new services, in 2016. Construction began during the natural gas boom years, and ended after the bust, just as the county budget was being squeezed and services were being cut. During the boom, the new building had seemed necessary, but with the revenue decreases, the county knew it was going to have a hard time paying the $2.1 million still owed on it. (Disclosure: My mother was on the library board when some of the decisions about the new building were made.) The library made its own budget cuts, but the savings weren’t enough to cover the shortfall in paying for the building, and there was a real danger of the library closing, leaving its new, hulking brick building empty. The people who didn’t frequent the library argued that the community didn’t really need it anymore, anyway. After all, if you have internet, you can get whatever you want in a day. Such was the situation when the pay raise showed up on the Quorum Court agenda. Why give one person a raise when the county was slashing its budget, when we were going without so much else? The head librarian candidate, Andrea Singleton, eventually took the job at the old salary, just over $19 an hour, although at first the fight made her upset enough to consider leaving. “It was enough to make me want to run away,” Ms. Singleton, who had been on the library’s staff for four years when she was offered the promotion, told me. “But I got over it.” When I spoke to other county residents, many thought all of the budget cuts were a sad but necessary correction to the county’s previously profligate ways. Ms. Hamilton, the Facebook commenter, told me that the voters fixed the county’s problems by electing Republicans to countywide offices in 2018, including Mr. James, who replaced a Democrat who’d held the office for four terms. “Some people are more fiscally responsible than others,” she said. Ms. Hamilton, who is 52, had moved to the county during the natural gas boom, in 2008, and continued working with that industry even after it left. She commutes each week to work in the Midland-Odessa area of Texas. She noted that Clinton is a small town and simply couldn’t afford the luxury of government services. “If you’re looking for a handout, this is not the place; we can’t support that,” Ms. Hamilton said. Mr. Widener, 50, has lived in the county on and off for 18 years, and was born in the nearby town of Conway, home to the University of Central Arkansas. He commutes there for work in the university’s information technology department. He told me the idea of paying the librarian $25 an hour was “typical government waste.” He added, “It’s the same thing in Washington.” The typical private-sector wage in Van Buren, $10 to $13 an hour, was right for the county, many people said. Anything more than that was wasteful, or evidence of government corruption. Almost everyone I spoke with feels that the county overspent during the gas boom years, and that the bill is coming due. “We got wasteful and stupid, and now we have to go back to common sense,” Corrine Weatherly, who owns a dress- and costume-making shop, Sew What, told me. Ms. Weatherly also runs the county fair, and so she shows up to almost every Quorum Court meeting. This worldview will continue to affect national elections. The most dominant news source here is Fox News, which I think helps perpetuate these attitudes. There’s another element, too: For decades, the dominant conservative theory of politics is that government should be run like a business, lean and efficient, and one of the biggest private employers here is Walmart, where Mr. James was working when he was elected. There’s a prevailing sense of scarcity — it’s easy for people who have lived much of their lives in a place where $25 an hour seems like a high salary to believe there just isn’t enough money to go around. The government, here and elsewhere, just can’t afford to help anyone, people told me. The attitude extends to national issues, like immigration. Ms. Hamilton told me she’d witnessed, in Texas, a hospital being practically bankrupted by the cost of caring for immigrants and said, “I don’t want my tax dollars to be used to pay for people that are coming here just to sit on a government ticket.” Mr. Widener, who described himself as “more libertarian” than anything else, told me his heart goes out to migrant children who are held in detention centers at the border, but he blames the parents who brought them to this country. Where I see needless cruelty, my neighbors see necessary reality. The people left in rural areas are more and more conservative, and convinced that the only way to get things done is to do them yourself. Especially as services have disappeared, they are more resentful about having to pay taxes, even ones that might restore those services. And many of those who want to live in a place with better schools, better roads and bigger public libraries have taken Ms. Hamilton’s suggestion — they’ve moved to places that can afford to offer them. This includes many of my peers from high school who left for college or jobs and permanently settled in bigger, wealthier cities and towns around the region. Over the summer, after the uproar about Ms. Singleton’s pay, library supporters gathered signatures for a special election that would have slightly increased the amount of county property taxes collected for the library, helping it pay off the new building and stave off closing altogether. It set off a new furor, even though the increase was estimated to cost about $20 a year for properties assessed at $100,000, and many people have properties valued at much less than that. Phillip Ellis, who was chosen to be chairman of the library board right before the controversies began, thought the outrage about the potential tax increase was more about philosophy than actual numbers. “I think it’s just anti-tax anything,” he said. He recounted some of the complaints people in the county had made to him about the proposed increase. “They’d say, ‘So-and-so has a big farm and they may not even use the library,’” he recalled. He would tell them, “Well, I don’t have children and never use the school.” With that sort of mentality, he said, “no one will do anything.” That was the crux of the issue — people didn’t want to pay for something they didn’t think they would use. I suspect that many residents are willing to pay for some institutions they see as necessary, like the sheriff’s department, but libraries, symbols of public education and public discourse, are more easily sacrificed. The library tax vote was quickly scrapped: Instead, Mr. James has suggested extending a 1 percent sales tax that went into place in 2001 to help pay for a new hospital building. Residents are due to vote on the idea in March. Many other counties have turned to sales taxes as property taxes dwindle: It means that people who stop to shop when they’re passing through pay it as well, but it’s also a tax that tends to fall harder on lower-income households. It is also likely to be more expensive for some residents than a property tax increase would have been, but it will be paid in small amounts over time at the grocery store and Walmart, and voters are less likely to notice it. If the tax extension passes, it’s estimated to pay off the library debt in about a year. But it delays a reckoning on whether and how the people who live here should contribute to the well-being of the county’s infrastructure and services. A considerable part of rural America is shrinking, and, for some, this means it’s time to go into retreat. Rather than pitching in to maintain what they have, people are willing to go it alone, to devote all their resources to their own homes and their own families. It makes me wonder if appeals from Democratic candidates still hoping to win Trump voters over by offering them more federal services will work. Many of the Democratic front-runners have released plans that call for more federal tax investment in rural infrastructure. Mr. Widener told me he had watched some of the Democratic debates, and his reaction was that everything the candidates proposed was “going to cost me money.” Economic appeals are not going to sway any Trump voters, who view anyone who is trying to increase government spending, especially to help other people, with disdain, even if it ultimately helps them, too. And Trump voters are carrying the day here in Van Buren County. They see Mr. Trump’s slashing of the national safety net and withdrawal from the international stage as necessities — these things reflect their own impulse writ large. They believe every tax dollar spent now is wasteful and foolish and they will have to pay for it later. It is as if there will be a nationwide scramble to cover the shortfall just as there was here with the library. As long as Democrats make promises to make their lives better with free college and Medicare for all sound like they include government spending, these voters will turn to Trump again — and it won’t matter how many scandals he’s been tarnished by.",VC,,1,"But while national polls show support for impeaching him is growing, it’s still divided sharply along partisan lines.|Democrats strongly favor it, while Republicans tend to oppose it|",1,"But while national polls show support for impeaching him is growing, it’s still divided sharply along partisan lines.

Matt Bevin (R) — 5,189 more votes, according to the uncertified final tally, or a margin of about 0.4 percentage points. But this doesn't appear to be the end of the process. Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes said her office considers Beshear the victor and doesn't believe Bevin can make up the gap. Yet Bevin refused to concede, citing unspecified ""irregularities,"" and The Associated Press hasn't called the race. Kentucky doesn't have an automatic recount provision, though candidates can petition — and bankroll — a statewide recount, Joe Sonka explains at the Louisville Courier Journal. First, losing candidates typically request a recanvas of the vote in each county. The recount is the next stage, and it involves a judge counting ballots and determining the winner, subject to appeal up to the Kentucky Supreme Court. Republican Senate President Robert Stivers suggested a dicier option Tuesday night: Let the GOP state legislature decide the winner. Section 90 of the state Constitution says ""contested elections for governor and lieutenant governor shall be determined by both houses of the General Assembly, according to such regulations as may be established by law."" Stivers said his staff believes that might apply in this case. The last ""contested"" governors race was in 1899, the Courier Journal reports. Sam Marcosson, a constitutional law professor at the University of Louisville, told the Courier Journal that Republicans can't just make up a legal procedure to review the election, and warned it's a risky ""proposition to suggest that the General Assembly would take vague allegations of unspecified irregularities and call into question a gubernatorial election."" Joshua Douglas, a professor at the University of Kentucky Law School, explained Bevin would have to call a special session of the General Assembly, then a panel of eight House members and three senators ""would hear evidence and make a final determination. And that determination would be final.""

11079,http://forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2019/03/31/what-i-dont-understand-about-pewdiepie/,1,0,,,1,"permanently appropriated by the alt-right|all the exceedingly tasteless jokes the YouTuber made, and implicated that he was a closet neo-Nazi.|",0,,,What I Don't Understand About PewDiePie,"“Subscribe to PewDiePie.” Once a harmless meme, or rather, a marketing campaign masked as a meme, “subscribe to PewDiePie” has twisted into a death cry, permanently appropriated by the alt-right. After his name was invoked by an alt-right terrorist, Pewdiepie tweeted his disgust at being associated with a mass-murderer. And that was all he had to say on the matter. PewDiePie's videos continued as normal, joking and laughing as though nothing had happened. No on-camera condemnation, no disassociation from the alt-right. Felix Kjellberg has 92 million subscribers and counting, a gargantuan audience spread across the globe, but the man only makes major headlines when controversy calls. And for Kjellberg, controversy is a frequent, albeit unwelcome, visitor. Kjellberg’s first big controversy came after the Wall Street Journal edited a compilation of all the exceedingly tasteless jokes the YouTuber made, and implicated that he was a closet neo-Nazi. I defended Kjellberg at the time, arguing that Kjellberg’s brand of childish humor was catering to his immature audience of “edgy” gamers, and that it was unfair to brand the man as something he clearly wasn’t. But in the time since, I’ve come to understand that edgy humor and “ironic racism” is integral to the alt-right’s indoctrination strategy, far from a harmless joke. It’s a fascinating and frightening rabbit hole to fall into, if you’ve got the time to look into it.That massive media backlash against Kjellberg was inevitable; there’s a point where someone is going to hold an immensely popular children’s entertainer accountable for making light of the Holocaust. But since that fateful controversy, Kjellberg has failed to truly distance himself from those who seek to warp his image into an alt-right icon, and even made a series of strange slip-ups that illuminate why hatemongers view him as one of their own. There’s the time Kjellberg said the n-word while playing a video game during a live-stream, which is something that … well, people who regularly use the n-word do. Kjellberg also recommended a video, an anime review, from a YouTube channel that pushes blatantly anti-Semitic and hateful rhetoric through pop culture commentary. The endorsement was reversed and noted as a mistake, but Kjellberg’s video response treated the incident as a joke, an overreaction, another media attempt to slander him. It was a weirdly dismissive response to the fact that Kjellberg had indeed directed his young and impressionable audience to neo-Nazi propaganda, mistakenly or not. And that, to me, is a very strange reaction. Personally, I don’t think Kjellberg is a closet Nazi, or even an alt-right sympathizer. From what I’ve seen of his videos, they’re fairly innocuous; the man’s appeal seems to stem from his authenticity, or at least, the impression of. But he is repeatedly criticized for mishandling the responsibility of his massive platform, for possibly contributing to the ever-growing issue of online indoctrination, and his response has mainly been to laugh. What is funny about that, exactly? There’s a certain point of popularity at which an entertainer ceases to become a person and transcends into a pop culture icon, where every action they take becomes disproportionately influential. The Twitter accounts they (used to) follow become outright endorsements, their tasteless jokes can be viewed as racist dog whistles. When Joe Rogan invites his buddy Alex Jones on to his podcast, that conversation isn’t just two guys drinking and having fun; it’s a golden opportunity for a hateful conspiracy theorist to spread his poison. Like Joe Rogan, Kjellberg’s words and actions are immensely consequential, rippling through society and sparking reactions that the man could never anticipate, nor desire. A creator who has convinced 92 million people to subscribe to their content should concern themselves with the message they are broadcasting, with the implication of their content. Kjellberg isn’t just some guy yelling into his microphone about memes; he has the reach of a major media outlet, and that’s a terrifying amount of responsibility for any individual. Kjellberg likely does not want to bear such a burden (who would?), but it is an inescapable aspect of his popularity, whether he acknowledges it or not. Any writer, influencer, or content creator can attest to the fact that constantly publicizing one’s personal opinions is an immensely stressful activity, especially to a large audience; it’s too easy to make mistakes, to make statements that one later regrets. From watching a number of his videos, I have to confess that I quite like Kjellberg; his content has improved as he’s matured, he can be both funny and insightful. But the subtle connection to the alt-right remains, and Kjellberg’s outright dismissal of the issue is unsettling. I don’t understand why Kjellberg doesn’t actively, aggressively push that segment of his audience away. The alt-right connection isn’t something the media conspired in a fever dream; instead of whining about articles criticizing him, why doesn’t Kjellberg question the fact that neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer sings his praises? That should be a cause for concern, to say the very least. Instead of inviting Ben Shapiro onto an episode of “Meme Review,” why not laugh at the fact that Shapiro dedicates the majority of his time and energy obsessing over pronouns? Isn’t there an opportunity to push away alt-right toxicity through humor? Celebrities associated with the fringes of the alt-right, like Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson, tend to fixate on their “unfair” portrayal in the media, without appearing to consider the legitimacy of the criticism, that there might be a very good reason why so many people are angry at them. Maybe it’s you, Felix.",VC,,0,,1,"Kjellberg’s first big controversy came after the Wall Street Journal edited a compilation of all the exceedingly tasteless jokes the YouTuber made, and implicated that he was a closet neo-Nazi||",0,

McMaster, claiming the previously low-profile civil servant wanted to “sabotage” President Donald Trump. The piece described Eric Ciaramella as “pro-Ukraine and anti-Russia” and alleged, with no evidence, that he was possibly responsible for high-level leaks. The response to the piece included online threats of violence against Ciaramella, which contributed to his decision to leave his job at the National Security Council a few weeks early, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Although the harassment was not the only factor, one of the two sources said they “distinctly got the impression” that the departure was premature, partially because of “right-wing” harassment. Ciaramella is not alone. Cernovich, who claims his Twitter feed receives over 100 million views every month, has been relentless in his criticism of McMaster and those around him. Cernovich’s writings and tweets have included false information, but sometimes they include details that only someone on the inside could know. For example, his tweets about Ciaramella were so specific that they documented meetings and lunches the NSC staffer had with certain people. After Ciaramella left the NSC, Cernovich turned his attacks on Twitter against his prospective successor, who has not been publicly announced. Career civil servants often endure stressful working conditions, but in the Trump White House, some of them face online trolling from alt-right bloggers who seek to portray them as clandestine partisans plotting to sabotage the president’s agenda. The online attacks often cite information that appears to be provided by unnamed White House officials or Trump loyalists. The trend has unnerved the career intelligence analysts, diplomats, security experts, and military officers who are accustomed to operating outside the political arena. Coupled with White House talking points accusing government employees of jeopardizing the country’s security through leaks to the media, the online abuse threatens to damage morale and politicize institutions long seen as impartial and above partisan combat. “It’s singling people out and then publicly engaging in character assassination,” said Bruce Riedel, a former career CIA officer who served in the agency for over 30 years and is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. “It will certainly send an intimidating effect throughout the bureaucracy.” Federal law is designed to shield career government employees from political or other retaliation unrelated to their performance on the job, but the administration has significant leeway to sideline them. Some previous presidents, most notably Richard Nixon, sought to undercut perceived political opponents in and outside of government, but the public harassment of civil servants by the current White House or its allies is something new, according to former government officials. Charles Kupchan, who served as senior director for European Affairs on the NSC during the Obama administration, and was Ciaramella’s boss for two years there, said he’s never seen a time of such attacks against civil servants. “In my professional recollection,” he said, “it’s unprecedented.” There may have been times when one person was singled out, but the “systemic hostility to what the alt-right calls the ‘deep state’ is misplaced,” Kupchan said, “and it’s dangerous.”Before the 2016 election, Cernovich wrote self-help books for men who wanted to discover their inner “alpha male.” He found a larger audience, however, with his fervent pro-Trump, Hillary Clinton-bashing online blogs, tweets, and memes. Tweeting from his home in Southern California, he helped spread the Pizzagate conspiracy theory and has threatened to smear members of the Trump White House if Stephen Bannon is ever removed. Those whom Cernovich targets often face a barrage of online threats and harassment from his followers. Last week, for example, he focused on Andrew Kaczynski, an investigative journalist at CNN. Kaczynski had written about the anonymous Reddit user who created a video of Trump wrestling a figure with CNN’s logo superimposed on his head. Cernovich doctored a photo so it appeared that Kaczynski was wearing a Nazi SS uniform. The Daily Beast reported that Kaczynski’s parents and wife “had received around 50 harassing phone calls each by Wednesday.” Still, members of Trump’s inner circle, and even his family members, have endorsed Cernovich’s posts. The White House has given him press credentials and he says he gets his information from West Wing officials, a claim supported by what he’s able to report and when he’s able to report it. For example, he warned his followers on April 6 that the White House had decided to launch military action against Syria, following the chemical weapons attack by President Bashar al-Assad’s regime, before the U.S. missile strikes occurred. “We do have time to stop it,” Cernovich told his audience at 7:40 p.m. In June, Cernovich turned his attention to Ciaramella, the NSC staffer. “Nothing in his résumé indicates that Ciaramella will put America First. His entire life arc indicates he will sabotage Trump and leak information to the press whenever possible,” Cernovich wrote, in an unsubstantiated allegation. Though he concedes it’s “unproven,” Cernovich said that “some suspect” Ciaramella leaked the details of Trump’s Oval Office meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. During the meeting, the president said firing FBI Director James Comey had relieved “great pressure” on him and that Comey was a “real nut job.” Trump also reportedly disclosed to Lavrov classified intelligence about the Islamic State provided by Israel. Both stories sent the White House into a tailspin. On Twitter, Cernovich’s followers and Trump loyalists responded to the piece about Ciaramella by calling for Trump to fire McMaster. Cernovich’s followers made death threats against Ciaramella, with calls for him to be shot between the eyes, as well as demands for his imprisonment. Shortly after Cernovich made the allegations, Ciaramella gave notice at the NSC. After his departure, Ciaramella, who was on loan to the White House, returned to his parent agency. Career civil servants from the Pentagon, the State Department, or one of the intelligence agencies routinely serve tours on the NSC. Ciaramella’s NSC stint started during the Obama administration. Following Trump’s inauguration, he stayed on at the request of the Trump transition team, working as acting senior director for European and Russian affairs. After McMaster picked Russia expert Fiona Hill to permanently fill that position, he asked Ciaramella to join the front office staff for the remainder of his NSC tour, which was scheduled to end in late June. Officials who worked closely with Ciaramella adamantly defend his professionalism and nonpartisan stance. He’s a “seasoned pro” and “one of the best that the civil service has,” said Kupchan, his former boss at the NSC. Now a professor at Georgetown University, Kupchan described civil servants, like Ciaramella, as “the worker bees of the federal government. They want to serve the nation, and they care deeply about the issues they’re working on.” Kupchan said he brought Ciaramella on board in 2015 to work on Ukraine. “He did such an impressive job, I asked him to help share the burden on the counter-ISIL portfolio,” and specifically Turkey’s role in that fight, he said. Yet Cernovich falsely tweeted on June 14 that Ciaramella had been “fired” because it was revealed that he had been leaking to the press, a statement that colleagues deny and that Cernovich corrected. On July 2, he tweeted that Ciaramella had quit because of his article. NSC spokesman Michael Anton said Ciaramella did not leave earlier than planned. “He left when his scheduled detail was up,” he wrote in an email. A senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the fact that Ciaramella was made acting director for European and Russian affairs and later brought up to serve as McMaster’s executive assistant demonstrates how well he performed. “H.R. thought he did a good job. Everybody was happy with his performance,” the official said. Referring to Ciaramella’s stint in the sensitive post of executive assistant to McMaster, the official said, “He wouldn’t have been there if he weren’t trusted.” But the official said there was no evidence that someone in the White House was feeding material to online bloggers and that the information appearing online could easily have come from an array of sources outside the White House. Numerous visitors to the White House pass through the West Wing, where the NSC is located and where the executive assistant to the national security advisor handles numerous phone calls, the official said. As a result, Ciaramella’s arrival or departure from the NSC would have been known to “probably hundreds if not thousands of people inside and outside the government,” the administration official said. Cernovich acknowledges that he’s going after McMaster’s staff. “Personnel is policy,” he wrote in response to queries for this article. “The NSC and State are the most interesting beats to cover, because the hiring and firing decisions within State and NSC will determine whether America enters another disastrous ground war, as H.R. McMaster and his mentor David Petraeus desire,” he wrote. “McMaster has stacked the NSC with pro-war globalists, some of whom came from the Obama administration and others who were ‘Never Trump’ers.’” In response to questions about some of his statements that have proven false, and whether he allows people to respond to his allegations, Cernovich responded by saying: “You are a spokeswoman for globalist warmongers. You are the mouthpiece of death and destruction. Your fraudulent hit piece on me validates the strength of my work.” Cernovich is not alone in going after NSC and other government staffers. Outlets, including Breitbart News and the Conservative Review, went on a rampage against government employees and so-called Obama holdovers in the early months of the Trump administration, as first documented by Politico in March. State Department officials took some of the hardest hits. Sahar Nowrouzzadeh, who started her career in the George W. Bush administration and who helped negotiate President Barack Obama’s Iran nuclear deal, was moved from her position on the State Department’s Policy Planning staff after critical right-wing media stories. Nowrouzzadeh is a career civil service employee who has served “with distinction” for nearly 12 years, said Acting Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs Stuart Jones. “Sahar has an outstanding reputation in the Department and we expect her to continue to do valuable work in furtherance of U.S. national security,” he said in an email. The Conservative Review also accused Alan Eyre, director of the Office of Middle East and Asia at the State Department and a career diplomat, of being a “leftist” who was anti-Trump. In another article, the publication said Anne Patterson, former assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, “fully embraced the policies of President Obama that aligned with radical Islamic actors and alienated Israel.” Defense Secretary James Mattis wanted to nominate Patterson to be his undersecretary for policy but faced resistance from the White House. Conservative outlets also attacked officials who guided the White House’s Israel policy, including NSC diplomat Yael Lempert and Michael Ratney, in charge of Israeli-Palestinian issues at the State Department. Lempert was accused of undermining Trump’s positions toward Israel, despite her negotiating a $38 billion deal to supply military hardware to Israel over 10 years. Pro-Israel conservatives slammed Ratney for his ties to former Secretary of State John Kerry. Lemper departed in April, less than a month after it was reported she’d be staying. The attacks don’t stop with career civil servants or perceived “Obama holdovers.” They also include people hired as political appointees by the Trump administration.The attacks don’t stop with career civil servants or perceived “Obama holdovers.” They also include people hired as political appointees by the Trump administration. A common theme underlying the online attacks is a perceived alignment with McMaster. Longtime Trump confidant and former campaign advisor Roger Stone, along with Alex Jones, who pushes conspiracy theories via his site Infowars, have attacked Hill, who was hired by McMaster to be senior director for European and Russian affairs on the NSC. Before joining the administration, Hill worked at the Brookings Institution, and earlier served as a national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia at the National Intelligence Council. In their video, Stone and Jones castigated Hill as a “mole” for billionaire investor George Soros. She “has been on the Soros payroll and the payroll of the Open Society Institute,” Stone said on Jones’s show. The online trolling fits within a broader idea pushed by Trump supporters in Washington and the media — the threat of a “deep state,” or the idea that an unseen group of people inside government are working against civilian leaders. The term has often been used in countries such as Egypt or Turkey, where members of the military and others have orchestrated coups. In Washington, the term “deep state” has been adopted in recent months to refer to the alleged threat from disloyal civil servants conspiring to harm the administration. “We are talking about the emergence of a deep state led by Barack Obama, and that is something that we should prevent,” Iowa Rep. Steve King said in March. The online attacks on the reputations of particular civil servants “has a very Nixonian quality to it,” Riedel, of Brookings, said. “What strikes me is there is another deep state that’s being fed information to wage war on the professional cadre.” A new target for online bashing is Megan Badasch, the NSC’s deputy executive secretary. Cernovich has accused her of leaking to the press and working with McMaster to orchestrate the departure of Tera Dahl, who was serving as the NSC’s deputy chief of staff. Dahl, a former Breitbart columnist, is taking a new job in the Trump administration, a move that was in the works for a while. Badasch is no Obama holdover; she has spent her career working in Republican politics, on Capitol Hill, and on presidential campaign teams. She was hired by the Trump campaign and worked on his transition team. When the White House sought to clamp down on leaks early in the administration, Badasch implemented a policy to restrict the distribution of documents within the government. One big mark against Badasch, according to Cernovich: She was seen eating lunch with her colleague, Ciaramella.",VC,,1," Coupled with White House talking points accusing government employees of jeopardizing the country’s security through leaks to the media, the online abuse threatens to damage morale and politicize institutions long seen as impartial and above partisan combat.|Some previous presidents, most notably Richard Nixon, sought to undercut perceived political opponents in and outside of government, but the public harassment of civil servants by the current White House or its allies is something new, according to former government officials.|There may have been times when one person was singled out, but the “systemic hostility to what the alt-right calls the ‘deep state’ is misplaced,” Kupchan said, “and it’s dangerous.",1,"The piece described Eric Ciaramella as “pro-Ukraine and anti-Russia” and alleged, with no evidence, that he was possibly responsible for high-level leaks.|Career civil servants often endure stressful working conditions, but in the Trump White House, some of them face online trolling from alt-right bloggers who seek to portray them as clandestine partisans plotting to sabotage the president’s agenda.|“It’s singling people out and then publicly engaging in character assassination,” said Bruce Riedel, a former career CIA officer who served in the agency for over 30 years and is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. “It will certainly send an intimidating effect throughout the bureaucracy.”",9,

""You'll hear this from your conservative uncle, and you may also hear this from a kid that's getting a lot of alt-right messaging online — that everyone's too sensitive today,"" she said. ""That is entryway kind of terminology. It's not racist. No, it's not. But it's often used against people who are calling out racism or sexism or homophobia.""Other terms she tells parents to listen for include snowflake; kek, a form of ""lol"" that sometimes refers to an ironic white nationalist 'religion'; cuck; chad; femenoid; beta; ""Blood and Soil,"" and the numbers 14 or 88, for their association with Hitler and Nazism.The words may not appear obviously racist or sexist in themselves, but they have been co-opted by extremists and, in some cases, taken on new meanings. It's the same with various emojis and symbols, like the bowl cut that is now a form of homage to the hairstyle of the racist killer who targeted a black church in Charleston; a glass of milk emoji, linking white pride and supposed masculinity; or two lightning bolts that can look like the insignia of the Nazi SS. Even the OK hand signal can be seen as racist in some situations, the Anti-Defamation League reported last month.Schroeder sent out a thread of warning tweets that went viral, including among parents getting ready to send their children back to school at the end of the summer. ""I wanted parents to know,"" she said. ""To pay attention, because this particular group of boys is being targeted and these parents have no idea.""Schroeder does not suggest that white teens are necessarily looking for extremist content, but the way the extremist content is constructed — whether it's ironic, irreverent or snarky — seems tailor-made for them. Words to watch for Beta: Refers to a weak man, as opposed to an alpha male ""They like to feel grown up and they like to feel they are no longer falling for baby humor. That irreverence feels good to them,"" she said. What they don't always know is what crosses the line. The memes begin to normalize ideals that are repugnant, she says. And those ideas can seem to have merit as teens go through the struggles of growing up. ""First boys are inundated by memes with subtly racist, sexist, and homophobic, anti-Semitic jokes and being kids, they don't see the nuance and they repeat and share,"" Schroeder said. ""Then they are shunned in school or socially."" It can push them to their online life and into the hands of those who ""understand"" them and think everyone else is being ""too sensitive,"" she said. Words to watch for ""Blood and Soil"": a key Nazi ideal that defines the mission of a supposed white race as protecting its ""homeland"" From there, many things can happen, almost none of them good. Boys can be labelled as Nazi sympathizers in comments that can follow them for years; they might troll someone and be sued; they might fall further down the radicalization rabbit hole and begin to actively seek out extremist friends and ideology. Their use of the white supremacist or neo-Nazi propaganda can cause deep fear and anxiety to those who are the targets. Good and bad reactions Schroeder admits she overreacted when she heard alt-right talking points coming out of her son's mouth, perhaps because it felt so personal to her. She became emotional and threatened to take away his phone. Words to watch for Redpilled: understanding the full truth of a situation, though for white supremacists this is accepting misogynistic alt-right theories Her husband intervened and she decided to dial it down. ""Condemning or shaming him would simply push him farther away from me and right into their hands. Shame is a force that I believe leads people to their worst decisions,"" Schroeder said. Instead, she was able to team up with her sons, sitting together and decoding memes and posts they now flag to her if they have concerns. And she will share material she has found with them. Words to watch for 14 or 88: used separately or together in reference to Hitler and white supremacy. 14 is the number of words in a popular slogan; 88 stands for ""Heil Hitler,"" because H is the alphabet's 8th letter And that means taking what Schroeder says is a vital step and getting on the same online sites and apps. She's blunt. ""I'm sorry parents, you have to have a Snapchat account,"" she said, adding parents should know how Reddit, Discord and Instagram Explore work. There's a world of social media far beyond Twitter and Facebook, from unmoderated bulletin boards full of hate to real-time chat while gaming, she said. Many of the social media companies have made moves to try to combat white supremacist propaganda. In March this year Facebook, which owns Instagram, announced it was banning ""praise, support and representation of white nationalism and white separatism on Facebook and Instagram."" That came after pressure from advocacy groups like the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Words to watch for SJW: stands for ""social justice warrior,"" a term used to mock civil rights activists After the deadly 2017 Unite the Right protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, Twitter suspended alt-right and white nationalists accounts. Reddit began putting threads that had white nationalist or alt-right propaganda under ""quarantine"" in 2017. And Discord, an app designed initially for communication between gamers, has begun purging white nationalist content. But Schroeder says parents have a role too in what she calls modern parenting. ""I taught them their ABCs, I potty trained them. My next big lesson is how to look at the media they are consuming constructively,"" Schroeder said. Words to watch for ((( ))): Triple Parentheses around a person's name denotes them as Jewish and a subject for anti-Semitic derision She responded to criticism that she was trying to ""brainwash"" her children. ""All parents are trying to bend their kids' minds. Whether it's getting them to wash their hands when they normally wouldn't or getting them to think about social issues in a way that's going to help society get better,"" she said. She's found a positive way to engage her sons. ""The kids and I are conspirators together,"" she said. She might point something out and then tell her boys, ""These alt-right guys were trying to trick you. Like they think you're dumb and you're not. You're smart.""",VC,,0,,0,,2,

They see the Democratic Party as desperate, willing to do anything to take the president down.|witch hunt",,How Florida Republicans Are Talking About Impeachment,"GAINESVILLE, Fla. — A few weeks ago, I sat on a park bench, watching my 11-year-old twins pass a soccer ball and push their friends on a tire swing. I turned to the mother of my daughters’ classmate to talk about the second whistle-blower coming forward about President Trump’s dealings with Ukraine. “Oh, I don’t care about that,” she said. “I’m just glad he’s standing his ground during this witch hunt.” I’ve been in this state for almost a decade, yet its politics still surprise me. Fox News tag lines come out of real people’s mouths. “I work hard. I don’t want the government giving my money away to people who don’t,” another mother added. My acquaintance agreed with her. “It’s one thing to need help, but so many people scam the system. Why should they get away with that? Having kids just for the welfare, using food stamps for steak and beer, finding every excuse not to work, and then I have to carry them with my tax dollars?” As the impeachment inquiry marches on, several polls show more American support for impeachment than not. Of course, we learned in 2016 that polls can sometimes mislead, and in this particular case, digging a little shows a deeply partisan divide. While nearly 50 percent of people polled now support impeachment, including 85 percent of Democrats, just 12 percent of Republicans do and upward of 70 percent of Republicans believe the president’s dealings with Ukraine are within typical presidential limits. Most Republicans think he meant to stop corruption and protect American interests, according to a CBS News poll. With a damning reconstructed phone call transcript, a detailed whistle-blower report, several high-ranking Trump surrogates being subpoenaed and testimonies well underway, how can such a seemingly cut-and-dry issue be read in an oppositional way? With farmers left in the dust, discrimination against pre-existing conditions returning to insurance coverage and taxes rising for millions, how can Republicans continue to support the president? Simple. They identify with him. Working-class Republicans in Alachua County see Donald Trump as a white businessman who made a lot of money. They like to think that could be them. The only thing standing in the way of achieving that dream, they tell me, are policies that elevate people of color, immigrants and poor people without health care. My neighbors misidentify what is holding them back, but they don’t want to correctly identify the actual problem — corporations, billionaires, white privilege, late-stage capitalism — because they hope to be part of that world someday. They think they have rightfully earned it. On a recent Saturday night, while sitting outside a bar with a friend, a man with just a few teeth started a conversation with me. The first thing he uttered was an apology for his lacking dental work. Like so many other Americans, he couldn’t afford to get them fixed. The conversation took an unexpected turn when he went on to rail against universal health care. He didn’t want to pay for other people to get help. He didn’t have health insurance and told me he once duct-taped a cut on his arm because he couldn’t afford stitches. “I’d rather take care of my own self with tape than be stuck in a system where I pay for everyone else,” he said. He didn’t want to be helped because that meant he might have to help other people he didn’t think of as deserving. Out at dinner last month with my husband, we had a discussion with a group of Trump-supporting women. Three of them had abortions in their younger years and admitted that without that service, their current lives would have been unattainable. But they continue to support the president because they feel their cases were different from the women needing these services today. “When I was younger, we didn’t use abortion as birth control like these girls now. It wasn’t like sending back a coffee; we put time and thought and tears and strife into that decision. Now it’s easy peasy.” The women we talked to felt they had more of a sense of responsibility and work ethic than the women currently facing these decisions. They don’t want to help others with their tax money because they think helping others will hurt themselves. Florida Republicans appreciate a man who has helped himself, who can boil talking points down to the black-and-white, easy delineations of fair and unfair. The more investigations and allegations leveled against Mr. Trump, the more fiercely they cling to him. He is being treated unfairly, they think, just like they are. He will understand their plight and help them. In their eyes, Mr. Trump is a patriotic man doing the best he can, and those who go against him are traitors to the country. They see the Democratic Party as desperate, willing to do anything to take the president down. They fully believe the conspiracy theories Mr. Trump spins on Twitter — from the birther movement to wind turbines causing cancer and everything in between. They subscribe to the “witch hunt” mentality he pushes forward. What Democrats see as self-pity and grandiose posturing, working-class Florida Republicans see as a man outspokenly demanding his rights in a way they wish they could. Republicans here can equate these “witch hunts” to things that have happened to them in their own lives. Just like they, unfairly, have not been able to move up in the world, so too is Mr. Trump, unfairly, being hunted down, his words and motives twisted to suit the needs of that same enemy. The investigations only strengthen their kinship with him. So, will Republicans come around to the idea of impeachment? The answer in Florida is probably not.

A pod of about a dozen dolphins broke the glassy surface off Taiji, the center of Japan’s annual dolphin hunt, which continues despite international outrage. Fishermen banged on semi-submerged poles to create an underwater wall of sound, driving the dolphins toward a narrow cove along the hilly, wooded Pacific shoreline about 80 miles southeast of Osaka. As the pod entered, a net was drawn across the cove. The dolphins swam in narrower and narrower circles, a calf sticking close to its mother. Then came the sound of thrashing. A slaughter followed — hidden from view under a temporary tarpaulin roof. The waters of the cove turned pink with blood. On this day in early September — the second of the hunt — 11 Risso’s dolphins were cut up for meat. The calf was released back into the ocean, facing likely death without its mother’s care. Taiji’s dolphin hunt shot to global infamy in 2009 with the Oscar-winning documentary “The Cove.” But the dolphin meat trade is not the main money-spinner sustaining Taiji’s hunt. Over the following two days, 13 bottlenose dolphins were captured alive — young, healthy animals selected from the pod by a team of Japanese aquarium trainers working alongside the fishermen.The animals fetch about $500 for meat. A live bottlenose, the easiest species to train, is worth between $8,000 and $10,000, and more than $40,000 after training, experts say. The live dolphins are mostly sent to China, where the marine park industry is booming and largely outside the international rulemaking that has turned its back on Taiji’s catch. China alone imported more than 200 live dolphins and whales from Japan in 2017 and 2018, trade data shows. “Taiji is ground zero for the captive dolphin industry,” said Rachel Carbary from Ric O’Barry’s Dolphin Project, which is headed by the “Flipper” trainer-turned-activist. Carbary, who came to Taiji to live-stream the hunt, is founder of Empty the Tanks, a group campaigning to end all dolphin and whale captivity. Under a quota system, Taiji’s fishermen are allowed to catch 1,749 dolphins or small whales from nine species during the six-month hunting season. Dolphins from Taiji have supplied aquariums across the world for decades — in Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Thailand, Russia and elsewhere. They have even been purchased by the U.S. Navy for mine detection and other tasks. But public outcry led the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) to prohibit its members in 2015 from acquiring dolphins captured by drive hunts such as Taiji’s. Now, China has taken over as Taiji’s main economic lifeline.In China, just one out of the more than 85 marine parks and related facilities belongs to WAZA. Naomi Rose, a marine mammal scientist at the Washington-based Animal Welfare Institute, has used live events and online video streaming in China to raise awareness of the health problems and stress experienced by captive marine mammals. Dolphins typically swim 25 miles a day in the wild and live in complex social groups, she says, so it’s hardly surprising they suffer in captivity. Attitudes in China are changing slowly, she said, but the country hasn’t yet had its “Blackfish” moment, citing the influence of the 2013 American documentary about captive killer whales. “The problem is there’s so many people in China that the potential customer base for these places is huge,” she said. In Taiji, hunting whales and dolphins is ‘part of our life’ The town of Taiji, on the southeastern coast of Japan’s main island, has lived by hunting whales and dolphins since the early 17th century. But the grisly depiction of the dolphin slaughter in “The Cove” brought global condemnation to this small, close-knit community. Activists from Sea Shepherd Conservation Society marched through town in black T-shirts and carrying their modified skull-and-crossbones flag. Locals accused the activists of constantly goading them, thrusting video cameras in their faces and showing photos of dead whales and dolphins to schoolchildren. Right-wing Japanese nationalists rallied to the cause and staged counterprotests in Taiji.These days, the town is calm, but wary. Police trailed Carbary as she went about her filming, while a Japan Coast Guard ship sat offshore to guard the hunt. “The people of Taiji have been engaged with whaling for more than 400 years; it’s part of our life,” said Yoshifumi Kai, a senior executive of the Taiji Fisheries Association. “We don’t have any industries here, and the available land is limited. In this environment, we have no other way but to try to gain our living from the sea.” But times may be changing — slowly. Sea Shepherd activists no longer come here. That is partly because Japan’s immigration authorities have banned many of them from entering the country. This year, they were replaced with a group of more than 30 Japanese animal rights activists, who marched peacefully through Taiji on Sept. 1 chanting slogans and holding banners to protest killing and capturing dolphins. On the way, they marched past Taiji’s Whale Museum. Inside, oblivious tourists from across Japan oohed and aahed as dolphins performed tricks for fish to cheesy rock music, and children lined up to stroke them. Speaking after a recent performance, several families said they seldom or never eat whale or dolphin meat, but all defended Japan’s “food culture.” “Eating this meat is part of our culture; it comes naturally,” said a 50-year-old man from the nearby city of Wakayama. “Foreigners think animals are cute, but you still eat beef, pork and the like,” said the man, who said he preferred only to give his family name, Go. “Isn’t it the same?” Taiji’s mayor battles the town’s ‘evil’ image Taiji’s mayor, Kazutaka Sangen, is a well-connected political operator with ties to the senior leadership of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the powerful, conservative pro-whaling lobby. It’s that support that helps Taiji withstand international criticism and mobilize the support of the coast guard and immigration authorities. But Sangen says the town’s relationship with whales needs to adapt. “The image of Taiji is evil, but that’s not an image that we want,” he said. Sangen has ambitious plans to turn Taiji into a major center of academic research on whales and dolphins. Instead of keeping dolphins in tiny pens, he wants to throw a net across nearby Moriura Bay. It would create a giant enclosure the size of about 40 soccer fields, where tourists could swim and kayak with dolphins and scientists could conduct research. In 10 or 15 years, the net would be removed in the hope dolphins would keep coming back. Western marine biologists aren’t keen on the plan, seeing it as just another way to exploit captive dolphins. But Jay Alabaster, who settled in Taiji to work on a doctorate on the dolphin hunt, said the town is beginning to catch up with changing global attitudes about how humans should interact with dolphins and whales.“Taiji is moving toward a place that even the extreme activists will find more palatable,” he said. “The town just needs some time and space to get there.” In the meantime, even Carbary said Taiji’s dolphin hunt needs to be put in a broader context. “This is not a Taiji, Japan, issue; this is a global issue, because the captivity industry is a global industry,” she said. “People need to understand that if they’re planning a vacation down to Mexico and they want to swim with dolphins in captivity, they’re encouraging this behavior and this hunting season to continue.”",VC,,0,,0,,0,

Kurt Volker, who resigned from his position at the State Department last week, said in a closed-door session with members of Congress that he attempted to warn Giuliani about the trustworthiness of information he received about Biden’s motivation for seeking the firing of Ukraine’s former prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, two people familiar with his testimony told the newspaper. Giuliani and Trump have sought to portray Biden as corrupt for demanding Shokin’s ouster while his son Hunter sat on the board of a Ukrainian company that Shokin had been investigating. Shokin’s investigation had been closed by 2016 when Biden, as vice president, made the demand on the Ukrainian government. The European Union and the International Monetary Fund shared the Obama administration’s view of Shokin as corrupt. Trump faces an impeachment inquiry over a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which, partly based on information passed to him by Giuliani, he asked the foreign leader to investigate Biden. Volker presented text message conversations among U.S. government officials that seemed to back the view by some Democrats that Trump was pushing for Zelensky’s cooperation in exchange for releasing military aid that had been appropriated by Congress but sequestered. I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,” Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, said in an exchange obtained by ABC News, prompting a reply from U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. “Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump’s intentions,” Sondland texted in response. “The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo’s of any kind. The President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign. “I suggest we stop the back and forth by text,” Sondland added. The Wall Street Journal also reported Thursday that Trump ordered the removal of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch after Giuliani complained that she was hindering efforts to launch an investigation of Biden. Yovanovitch is scheduled to appear before the House Intelligence Committee on Oct. 11. Asked about the recall of Yovanovitch on Thursday, Trump responded: “I don’t know if I recalled her or somebody recalled her but I heard very, very bad things about her for a long period of time. Not good.” Earlier Thursday, Trump himself had publicly repeated his call for Ukraine to investigate Biden, adding China to the countries whose help he is actively seeking in what Giuliani has boasted is an effort to discredit a likely opponent of Trump’s reelection bid. “They should investigate the Bidens because how does a company that’s newly formed and all these companies, and by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,” Trump told reporters Thursday. “So I would say with President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend they start an investigation into the Bidens, because nobody has any doubt that they weren’t crooked.” Ellen Weintraub, chair of the Federal Election Committee, issued a statement Thursday noting that soliciting assistance in a federal election from noncitizens, let alone foreign governments, is against the law.

Kremlin: no official reply to invitation for Trump to visit Moscow “I appreciate the invitation. It is right in the middle of political season, so I’ll see if I can do it, but I would love to go if I could,” Trump told reporters before departing the White House for campaign-related events. Putin presides over an annual parade to commemorate the Soviet Union’s World War Two victory over Nazi Germany, but the Kremlin has said next year’s 75th anniversary would be marked with great pomp. Trump called it “a very big deal celebrating the end of the war.” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was cited by RIA news agency as saying on Thursday that Putin’s invitation to his U.S. counterpart to attend Victory Day in Moscow had been “received with interest,” but there had not yet been any reply from the White House. While U.S.-Russia relations have hit a low point after American intelligence agencies concluded that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election to help Trump, the two leaders have maintained what appears to be a good relationship.",VC,,0,,0,,0,

It was a largely uninteresting affair, presenting an opportunity for Democratic candidates to position themselves as being the most “electable” among their peers and best able to defeat Donald Trump. A far more exciting backdrop was provided by the public impeachment hearings being held in the House of Representatives. After a week or so of public hearings it is increasingly obvious that Donald Trump and his minions engaged in a Mafia-style bribery, extortion, and shakedown operation against Ukraine, with the goal of forcing that nation’s leaders to aid Trump in the 2020 presidential election. This is a gross abuse of power and violation of the rule of law and the Constitution. It is one example among many of Donald Trump, his minions, the Republican Party, their disinformation news media and their army of cultists putting loyalty to Trump over the good of the United States. Public opinion and other research suggests that the Democratic Party’s nominee should defeat Donald Trump in 2020. But which of the Democrats now running has the best chance? Will Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or some other candidate be the champion of American democracy against the tyrant in waiting who now occupies the Oval Office? I recently spoke with Thom Hartmann about the Democratic Party, the 2020 presidential election, and the Age of Trump. He is the host of the most popular progressive radio show in the country, a New York Times bestselling author, and one of the country’s leading progressive voices. Hartmann’s new book is “The Hidden History of the Supreme Court and the Betrayal of America.” Hartmann’s program can be heard from 12 to 3 p.m., Eastern time, via the nonprofit Pacifica Network and on commercial radio stations all across the United States. In this conversation, Hartmann argues that concerns about “electability” are misplaced and that a progressive candidate such as Warren or Sanders actually has a much better chance of defeating Donald Trump than Joe Biden does. Hartmann also sounds the alarm about the deep desperation which moved so many Americans to support such a dangerous and unqualified person in the first place. Hartmann also expressed his deep concern that if Trump wins re-election it will be the end of American democracy, and that Trump and the Republican Party’s right-wing paramilitaries and political terrorists will be fully unleashed against the American people. As usual, this conversation has been edited for clarity and length. What advice do you have for Americans who feel lost and devastated by Trump’s presidency and are increasingly stuck in a state of learned helplessness? Keep in mind that this country has been through far worse than Donald Trump. The United States has been through the Civil War. We went through the Revolutionary War with England. We went through two world wars. We went through the Vietnam War. Short of someone starting World War III, I suspect that the United States will bounce back from this situation with Donald Trump. The one thing that causes me to think that we might not — and which is the subject of my new book “The Hidden History of the Supreme Court and the Betrayal of America” — is how the United States Supreme Court has basically betrayed our country. The definition of a democracy is where the people vote for what they want and then they get that through the government. That has not been the case since 1981.Whether it’s the social safety net, protecting the environment, decreasing our military activity abroad, making policing more humane, recognizing civil rights, encouraging voter rights, strengthening the middle class and protecting Social Security and Medicare, none of those things have happened. In fact, the opposite has happened. How is Trumpism a symptom and not the cause of much bigger social, political, economic and other cultural problems in America? Renewing the country’s democracy to prevent another fascist president is going to require deep systemic change, not just voting Donald Trump out of office The thing that concerns me the most is that in the United States we now have corporations and billionaires who have taken over our political system completely. Social scientists have shown that what the bottom 90% of income earners want in America is literally random noise for America’s policymakers. By comparison, what the top 10% want is consistently enacted through legislation. This means no more democracy. And then on top of that power dynamic the courts have swung to the far right and are hard corporatist. I’m worried that if we as a country do not get money in politics under control quickly, we are going to slide into straight fascism, what is a type of authoritarian fascism. The United States is heading in that direction. The 2020 election might interrupt that tide. But then the other big danger is, say for example there is a Democratic president after Trump and perhaps even the Democrats get control of the House and Senate and then everyone says, “Well, we’ve got to be careful that a future president does not have as much power as Trump does.” Then we start dialing back the powers of the presidency at the exact same time that a President Sanders or a President Warren might be trying to use the powers of the presidency to get corporate money out of our political system, to rebuild the social safety net, and to reject Reaganomics by creating a return to a better and more equitable type of New Deal economics. Those efforts may be sabotaged before they even begin. Such an outcome would be something that both Republicans and corporate Democrats would be quite enthusiastic about. The Ukraine scandal is another example of Trump’s many abuses of power. There are also the emoluments clause violations and other corruption by Trump and his inner circle. But what needs to be spoken about much more by the American mainstream news media is that the Trump regime has exposed an entire criminal class of American elites. This is state capture and rent-seeking behavior that one usually sees in banana republics and failed democracies, not “advanced democracies.” The common denominator among many countries is where democracies — even if only for a relatively short period of time — fall into a more authoritarian form of government. And in every case, they’re being run by a person who has the strong backing of a criminal class of billionaires or other very rich people. There is a criminal wealthy class in the United States. We just don’t call them criminals. But they engage in massive tax fraud and generally get to do whatever they want without fear of punishment or being thrown in jail. What is your assessment of the health of the rule of law in America under the Trump regime? My main concern is the institutions of the law. When the institutions of law become the law breakers — for example, when the Justice Department prosecutes itself as Trump is directing Bill Barr to do right now in service of these conspiracy theories about Ukraine and Russia and whistleblowers — the legal institutions are being politicized. This represents an institutional breakdown that then leads to the dissolution of a functioning system of law. Where is the mass public resistance to the Trump regime? There should be a national strike. Have the American people wholly surrendered? I think people have been beaten down. America is being governed by surprise. That consistent shock, instability and insecurity is a strategy used by autocrats. Right now, Donald Trump is using the presidency to fuel his ego and put money in his own pockets. My concern is that when Trump leaves and he gets replaced by an even more corrupt Republican president — which will happen — that Trump successor will have studied the playbook and will be much more dangerous. When a Trump Republican successor gets in the White House and he believes that it is his destiny to alter the fate of the world or it is his job to bring peace for a thousand years or they have a God complex where they believe that it is their destiny to crush all opposition in the name of what’s good and holy, then I am not sure how brutal things will become in this country. What would a Walter Cronkite-like figure have done with someone like Donald Trump? I do not believe that Donald Trump would have become president if there were a Walter Cronkite and that type of serious news programming. If real news people were in control, they would have looked at what Trump was doing and said, “This is attention seeking behavior and we’re not going to treat it as ‘breaking news’.” Real news people would not have given Donald Trump billions of dollars in free time. How do you assess the Democratic candidates and the presidential primary debates? I am hopeful that we will get one of the two progressives in the race at the top of the Democratic Party presidential ticket for 2020. Then there will be enough progressives in the House and Senate that we can revisit the New Deal or the 1960s Great Society and much-needed social programs can be moved forward and implemented appropriately. But instead of progressive candidates, what we’re getting is the safety valve. Issues such as guaranteed minimum income are being spoken about during the Democratic presidential primary debates because elites know none of those issues have a chance of ever becoming law in the United States right now. I believe that Donald Trump is likely going to win another term in 2020, and do so by a comfortable margin. What is your prediction? My concern is that if Donald Trump wins a second term, that is the end of the United States of America. Donald Trump has no understanding of constitutional governance. He and his Republican Party and other supporters do not care about such things. If Trump wins again there will be right-wing paramilitaries, enforcers, and brownshirts in the streets. But I do think we are too far out from Election Day 2020 to know if Trump will win. It will largely by determined by who the Democrats choose to be their nominee. My biggest fear is that if a milquetoast Democrat is chosen then we basically repeat the Clinton presidency. With that outcome, America continues to slide in the direction of full-on corporatism. And what about these discussions about “electability” and the field of Democratic presidential nominees? How do you respond to those people who tell you on your radio show that they really like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren but they are voting for Joe Biden because he has the best chance to win over “Middle America”? It’s nonsense. How does anyone know that? What makes someone think that Biden has the best chance of winning? Just look at the primaries. Consider how Bernie did in the Midwest, for example. Bernie or Warren have the potential to walk away with it all. The American people are so desperate for change. They know that they’ve been screwed by Reaganomics, which was a destructive assault on the American middle class. There are people so desperate in America that they are willing to vote for an orange-faced buffoon or mobbed-up New York real estate guy. That is an act of desperation.",CR,,1,"But then the other big danger is, say for example there is a Democratic president after Trump and perhaps even the Democrats get control of the House and Senate and then everyone says, “Well, we’ve got to be careful that a future president does not have as much power as Trump does.”||",1,"After a week or so of public hearings it is increasingly obvious that Donald Trump and his minions engaged in a Mafia-style bribery, extortion, and shakedown operation against Ukraine, with the goal of forcing that nation’s leaders to aid Trump in the 2020 presidential election.|It is one example among many of Donald Trump, his minions, the Republican Party, their disinformation news media and their army of cultists putting loyalty to Trump over the good of the United States.|Will Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or some other candidate be the champion of American democracy against the tyrant in waiting who now occupies the Oval Office?",1,"After a week or so of public hearings it is increasingly obvious that Donald Trump and his minions engaged in a Mafia-style bribery, extortion, and shakedown operation against Ukraine, with the goal of forcing that nation’s leaders to aid Trump in the 2020 presidential election.|It is one example among many of Donald Trump, his minions, the Republican Party, their disinformation news media and their army of cultists putting loyalty to Trump over the good of the United States.|It is one example among many of Donald Trump, his minions, the Republican Party, their disinformation news media and their army of cultists putting loyalty to Trump over the good of the United States."

",,"Election Day 2019: Key Votes in Virginia, Kentucky, Mississippi","In Virginia, Democrats have taken control of both the Senate and the House, where Republicans had held slim majorities. It is the first time in a generation that Virginia state government will be under full Democratic control. In the Kentucky governor’s race, the Democratic challenger, Attorney General Andy Beshear, holds a slight lead over the Republican incumbent, Matt Bevin, and claimed victory. But the race was too close to call. Democrats were looking for an upset victory in the Mississippi governor’s race, but Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, defeated Attorney General Jim Hood by about five percentage points. There were also political offices and referendums on the ballot in Maine, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Colorado on Tuesday. Follow our results pages for the Virginia legislature and for the governor’s races in Kentucky and Mississippi, with continuous updates through Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. (This page is no longer being updated.) The big picture Tuesday’s election results offer insights on two crucial political dynamics heading into the 2020 campaign: the depth of President Trump’s appeal with Republicans and how fully suburban voters have swung to the Democrats. The Republican candidates for governor in Kentucky and Mississippi have aggressively linked themselves to Mr. Trump and sought to tie their rivals to the national Democrats pursuing the impeachment inquiry against the president. Mr. Trump, who comfortably carried both states in 2016, has put his political capital on the line: He rallied voters in Mississippi on Friday and was in Kentucky on Monday night. The president has not appeared on the campaign trail in Virginia, where Democrats had hoped that Mr. Trump’s deep unpopularity in the suburbs would be enough for them to flip control of both chambers of the state legislature. They succeeded on Tuesday. Virginia is the only Southern state the president lost in 2016, and Republicans faced a series of difficult races in metropolitan districts. The 2019 election season does not end Tuesday, however. On Saturday, Nov. 16, Louisiana voters will choose between Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, and his challenger, the businessman Eddie Rispone. It’s another race where the Republicans are trying to harness Mr. Trump’s standing with conservative voters and their dismay over his looming impeachment to nationalize a state election. Mr. Trump, who has already been to Louisiana once for Republicans this fall, is headed back there later this week to stump for Mr. Rispone. Who is less unpopular in Kentucky? Voters in Kentucky faced a difficult choice on Tuesday, between an unpopular governor and an unpopular party. If elected, Matt Bevin would be the first Republican governor in the state’s history to win a second term. The partisan gravity, in a red state that is still quite fond of Mr. Trump, would seem to favor him heavily. But Mr. Bevin’s broad personal unpopularity has made this a tossup, with the race ending on Tuesday night with results too close to call. Drawing support from schoolteachers and others who have felt insulted or bullied by the governor, Andy Beshear, the Democratic state attorney general and the son of Mr. Bevin’s immediate predecessor, entered the general election with a lead. But a summer of ads drawing attention to Mr. Beshear’s (or his party’s) positions on abortion, immigration and the president steadily dragged down that early edge. The impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump is energizing Republicans while Mr. Beshear has sought to focus on local issues. The question is whether an aversion to a particular politician, Mr. Bevin, is greater than an aversion to a particular political party, i.e., the Democrats. Woodford County, just outside of Lexington, is one of the city’s growing suburban communities and a destination for bourbon tourists. In the 2011 governor’s race, Woodford voted for the Democrat, Steve Beshear, by a more than 2-to-1 margin. In 2015, the county narrowly elected Mr. Bevin. Welby Southerland, who was getting into his car on Tuesday after voting downstairs at the county courthouse, isn’t sure that was a good decision. “I want a new governor,” said Mr. Southerland, 76, who spent his life working on farms and in feed mills. “The one we have lies quite a bit.” His thoughts were echoed by Missy Rogers, 67, who could not understand the way Mr. Bevin has treated teachers. Ms. Rogers is not a teacher herself — she manages stores in the Lexington area that sell homemade dollhouses. But she was furious about the governor’s treatment of them, even baffled by it. “It’s just insane to hurt teachers,” she said. And so she voted straight-ticket Democrat to send Mr. Bevin a message. Well, Mr. Bevin and someone else. “I just think Trump is evil,” she said. “He just wants to hurt so many people.” A vote against Mr. Bevin was, for her, also a vote against Mr. Trump. That was the calculus. Mr. Beshear’s name hardly came up. Murphy Smith, 64, walking out of the courthouse shortly after Ms. Rogers, saw the same sort of connection. “He’s like Trump,” Mr. Smith said of Mr. Bevin. But for him this worked in the opposite direction. “And I’m a Trump man,” he said. ‘Meanspirited’ and ‘imperious’: Some Kentucky voters fed up with governor At a Knights of Columbus gathering on the banks of the Ohio River, many said they had voted for Mr. Beshear, the Democratic challenger, driven by their dissatisfaction with Mr. Bevin. “I’m a lifelong Republican,” John Whitt, a retired physician, said just after voting on Tuesday afternoon. But, he added, that he has two daughters who are teachers. “I think education is the biggest thing,” Dr. Whitt, 72, said, “the preservation of public schools.” Arthur Blanford and his wife, Nancy, agreed. Dr. Blanford, a physician, said his vote was about “treating teachers well, and without disparagement.” He supported better pay for educators. And, as a doctor, he wanted more resources channeled toward handling the opioid crisis ravaging Kentucky, like much of the country, and opposed Mr. Bevin’s push to curb the Medicaid expansion pursued by his predecessor. “We’ve voted Democrat for a long time,” he said of he and his wife, adding that they also voted for Amy McGrath, a Democrat challenging the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell. “We’re ditching Moscow Mitch,” he said, referring to a nickname detractors have given the Republican senator. The Blanfords, like others who voted for Andy Beshear, the state’s attorney general, said they were not so enthusiastic about the candidate; more so, they were outraged with Mr. Bevin, turned off by his personality as much as his stance on issues. “He’s imperious,” Dr. Blanford said. “And meanspirited,” Ms. Blanford, a retired classical flutist, added. John Brown, who has worked in heating and air-conditioning for more than 30 years, said that he has wavered between parties over the years. This time, he also voted for Mr. Beshear. “I watch the news, and that’s how I vote, “He has poor manners,” Mr. Brown, 62, said, adding that he does not care for his hotheaded temperament, which was apparent in seeing him talk. “You can tell his blood pressure is rising.” The battle for Virginia’s suburbs Virginians decided to hand power to Democrats for the first time in a generation. Major policy issues like gun safety were at stake, as well as control over drawing new voting districts in 2021. All 140 seats in both chambers were on the ballot. Republicans had held slim majorities of 20-19 in the Senate and 51-48 in the House of Delegates, with one vacancy in each. A strongly Republican state, Mississippi elected as governor Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican who has been endorsed by the outgoing Republican governor, over Attorney General Jim Hood, an anti-abortion, pro-gun Democrat. The race was competitive, but Mississippi is an uphill climb for any Democrat.Election Day began smoothly for the most part, with scattered reports of problems at polling places but no evidence of any systemic disruption of voting. Some polls opened late in Texas, and in Pennsylvania, where voting machines are particularly antiquated, some breakdowns were reported, according to poll monitors and callers to a hotline run by Election Protection, a consortium of groups promoting voting rights. Pennsylvanians at polls with broken machines cast their votes on paper ballots. In Revere, near Philadelphia, a Democratic candidate for mayor complained online that his supporters were being challenged as they sought to vote, but the report could not be immediately verified. In North Carolina, a state website that helps voters find their polling place was briefly out of commission at midmorning. And in Richmond, Va., one precinct was reported to have run out of ballots by 8 a.m. In Georgia, electronic voter-registration books were out of commission part of Tuesday morning in at least five Georgia counties, including Paulding County in suburban Atlanta. Election Protection officials said a number of voters in two Georgia counties were not listed in registration records, an issue that led to a lawsuit in 2018. Some Houston polls reported long lines in areas with hotly contested city races. And in Louisville, voting hours were extended at one poll in an elementary school after reports of an armed person near the school led to a lockdown that lasted roughly an hour. Police officers later arrested a suspect. And in Marion, Ohio, a Republican Party official and a candidate for city auditor were arrested on Tuesday on charges of distributing campaign fliers crafted to look like sample ballots. Ohio law bars distributing phony sample ballots, and offenders can be fined up to $1,000 and jailed for up to six months. Erroneous voting instructions and other disinformation began popping up on a handful of Twitter accounts on Monday, including one post encouraging Kentucky supporters of Mr. Bevin to vote on Wednesday. That and other posts were removed and some accounts were closed after being reported, according to David Vance, a spokesman for Common Cause, a member of the Election Protection alliance. None appeared to have spread widely. Ranked-choice voting on the ballot in New York City In New York State, voters were able to cast ballots for a week prior to Election Day under a newly implemented early voting process. In Democratic-heavy New York City, two Democrats easily defeated their Republican opposition: Jumaane Williams, of Brooklyn, won re-election for public advocate. Melinda Katz, the Queens borough president, won the district attorney race. City voters also faced five ballot questions, including whether to create ranked-choice in future elections (the next mayor’s race is in 2021). To fit all the questions in English and Spanish on one ballot sheet, election officials used tiny seven-point font. L. Joy Williams, the president of the Brooklyn chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., voted Tuesday morning in Bushwick, Brooklyn. She said she voted against ranked-choice voting because supporters had not shown how it would work in a crowded election season. “What does the ballot look like?” she asked. Voting was quick. “I double parked and had my flashes on in front of a school,” Ms. Williams recalled. “It was maybe less than 5 minutes.” Christina Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University voted on Thursday in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. “It was not busy at all, but it was disorganized,” she said. In Monroe County, which includes Rochester, George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist, spent more than $800,000 to support Shani Curry Mitchell, a Democratic candidate challenging the incumbent Republican. Despite the attention that caused, turnout was on par with prior elections, according to Colleen Anderson, the Democratic Commissioner of the Monroe County Board of Elections. A proxy battle for the future of New Jersey Republicans Democrats remain in firm control of the State Assembly in New Jersey and only a handful of races are competitive this year, but an existential threat looms for the Republican Party in New Jersey, one year after being nearly wiped off the map in the 2018 congressional elections. Final results were still being tallied Tuesday night. And in District 21, Jon Bramnick, the Republican leader in the assembly who has been a fixture in Trenton for nearly two decades and a staunch ally of Chris Christie, the former governor, was in the fight of his political life. The state district, which largely resides in the congressional district that Representative Tom Malinowski flipped from red to blue last year, is part of the recent prototypical Jersey suburban revolt: abandoning the Republican Party in droves in response to the Trump era (and, to a potentially equal extent, the loss of the state and local tax deduction in the Trump tax cuts).Mr. Bramnick, however, has maintained the traditional Jersey moderate Republican course that appealed to the once reliably Republican suburbs. He is highly critical of Mr. Trump, but is also staunchly opposing the liberal policies of Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, depicting him as a socialist, tax-and-spend liberal. Should Mr. Bramnick lose, it will damage more than just the morale of a struggling state party. Conservatives could attribute his loss to his criticism of Mr. Trump, and push for a more hard-line state party. But aligning with a deeply unpopular president in the state could only further doom the dwindling Republican presence in Trenton.

The body of Sol Pais was found Wednesday morning at the base of Mount Evans in Clear Creek County — but officials believe she died nearly two days earlier of suicide, the Denver Post reported. “She had no idea what occurred from late Monday afternoon to Tuesday when a search for her began and to Wednesday when her body was found,” Clear Creek County Undersheriff Bruce Snelling told the Denver Post. “The logical likelihood was she was here to end her journey.” FBI officials suspected 18-year-old Pais was plotting an attack because she appeared “infatuated” with the Columbine High School massacre and arrived days before the shooting’s 20th anniversary. The Miami high school student boarded a flight Monday to Denver — then purchased a firearm and ammunition at a Littleton gun shop, not far from the Columbine campus, according to officials. Her behavior incited panic Tuesday in the Denver area, where more than 20 schools, including Columbine, were closed and a nearly 24-hour manhunt got underway. But authorities said Pais ultimately didn’t have a “master plan” to go on a shooting spree. She “went dark” after a ride-share driver dropped her off Monday afternoon near Mount Evans, where her body was later discovered, officials said. “There was no digital footprint anywhere,” Snelling told the Denver Post. “No phone. No credit card use. To me, that pointed to a near impossibility that this ill-equipped, 18-year-old teenage woman would fly from sea level in Florida to Colorado and then go up into the mountains with plans to go on a killing spree.” ",CR,,0,||,0,||,0,||

Erdogan brought out an iPad and showed the senators an anti-Kurds video, leading to a heated exchange about the Kurds and his treatment of them. Turkey launched an incursion into northern Syria against the Kurds in recent weeks, as the president decided to withdraw U.S. troops from the region after a phone conversation with the authoritarian leader Erdogan. The Oval Office video display, first reported by Axios, did not please the Republican senators, who have expressed deep concerns about Turkey's incursion into Syria and affront against the Kurds. The meeting had been officially called by the White House so the key GOP senators — Sens. Lindsey Graham, Ted Cruz, Joni Ernst, Jim Risch and Rick Scott — could help the president convince Erdogan not to buy Russian military equipment and focus instead on purchasing American equipment. There was no resolution in that meeting, one source noted. After that meeting in a press conference alongside Erdogan, the president insisted he's a ""big fan"" of Erdogan, and claimed he thinks Erdogan has a positive relationship with the Kurds. The president in the past has described the Kurds as ""not angels,"" despite the fact that the Kurds are U.S. allies who fought alongside U.S. troops against ISIS. ""They're not angels. They're not angels. Take a look. You have to go back and take a look,"" Mr. Trump said last month. Graham told Axios after the meeting, ""The Turkish narrative that they have done more to destroy ISIS, I rejected forcefully, and I let Turkey know that 10,000 SDF fighters, mostly Kurds, suffered, died or injured, in the fight against ISIS, and America will not forget that and will not abandon them.""",VC,,0,,1,"The Oval Office video display, first reported by Axios, did not please the Republican senators, who have expressed deep concerns about Turkey's incursion into Syria and affront against the Kurds. ||",0,

The incident comes amid rising hostility faced by journalists as the Trump administration continues to attack the media as “fake news.” Watson said he had heard a couple stories of similar encounters in the past, but said he did not realize until sharing his experience at the Dulles Airport on social media just how many people in his field were reporting the same brand of harassment. U.S. airport border agents were at the center of several incidents that have raised reporters’ concerns this year. “I’ve honestly never had a human attempt to provoke me like this before in my life,” Watson said he told his colleagues. “This behavior is totally normal now, I guess?” Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that it is investigating the “alleged inappropriate conduct.” “We hold our employees accountable to our core values of vigilance, integrity and service to country, and do not tolerate inappropriate comments or behavior by our employees,” the agency said. Standards of conduct for the Department of Homeland Security, CBP’s parent agency, direct staff to “act impartially.” An article from Defense One describes Watson’s full recollection of Thursday’s conversation. After the second alleged query by the CBP officer, Watson explained that he covers national security “with many of the same skills” he used as a public affairs officer in the Army — and added: “Some would argue that’s propaganda.” When the officer repeated his question a third time, Watson said, he paused. His wife had already circled the airport for 20 minutes. He figured he could get stuck for hours if he tried to call in the officer’s supervisor. So he gave in. “For the purposes of expediting this conversation, yes,” he recalled telling the CBP officer. The officer made Watson agree one more time before letting him through, Watson said. He says he’s filed a civil rights complaint with DHS. “We are disappointed and concerned that any U.S. official would question a journalist, or any citizen, in this way,” Kevin Baron, Defense One’s executive editor, wrote to The Post. Others in journalism circles and beyond were quick to point out chilling implications in the story. Walter Shaub, an attorney who served as director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics until 2017, tweeted that the incident should go to the DHS inspector general for review. “A customs agent withholding the passport of a journalist until he agrees to say he writes ‘propaganda’ is actionable misconduct, even in Trump’s America,” he said. A growing list of journalists say they have been startled by government officials’ harassment in a country that prizes freedom of the press. The encounters are raising fears that hostile rhetoric led by President Trump and his allies are damaging reporters’ ability to do their job unhindered. This spring, the World Press Freedom Index called journalists’ treatment in the United States “problematic” for the first time in its 17 years of assessments — and singled out “President Trump’s anti-press rhetoric and continuing threats to journalists” as driving the deteriorating conditions. The U.S. ranking on the index has fallen for the past three years. Journalists have had reporting run-ins with border agents for years, too. In 2016, a Canadian photographer on his way to cover protests in the United States was detained for more than six hours. Ed Ou said airport officers took away his cellphones after he refused to unlock them, saying he needed to protect his sources. When Ou got the devices back, he suspected tampering and potential data copying. As Andrea Peterson reported in The Post: If Ou had already been inside the U.S. border, law enforcement officers would have needed a warrant to search his smartphones to comply with a 2014 Supreme Court ruling. But the journalist learned the hard way that the same rules don’t apply at the border, where the government claims the right to search electronic devices without a warrant or any suspicion of wrongdoing. Several other journalists have described difficulties getting through airports in 2019. In February, CBP apologized to a BuzzFeed journalist questioned at a New York airport about his news organization’s coverage of Trump and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation. A few months later, a freelancer said he was detained by CBP officials for hours at an airport in Texas. Then, in August, British journalist James Dyer described an “unsettling experience” as he flew into California to cover a Disney event. The film and TV writer said a CBP officer at Los Angeles International Airport called him a member of the “fake news media” and asked if he had worked for CNN or MSNBC, two frequent targets of Trump’s criticism. “He aggressively told me that journalists are liars and are attacking their democracy,” Dyer wrote in a viral tweet thread. He said he was allowed to move on after explaining that he was just trying to write about Star Wars. CBP’s response at the time was much like its statement on Thursday’s incident. “Inappropriate comments or behavior are not tolerated, and do not reflect our values of vigilance, integrity and professionalism,” the agency said. CBP did not address broader concerns about its officers’ treatment of journalists in its Friday statement on the Dulles Airport incident.",CR,,1,"This spring, the World Press Freedom Index called journalists’ treatment in the United States “problematic” for the first time in its 17 years of assessments — and singled out “President Trump’s anti-press rhetoric and continuing threats to journalists” as driving the deteriorating conditions||",0,||,1,"The incident comes amid rising hostility faced by journalists as the Trump administration continues to attack the media as “fake news.”|“A customs agent withholding the passport of a journalist until he agrees to say he writes ‘propaganda’ is actionable misconduct, even in Trump’s America,” he said.|"

In the first formal test of support for the impeachment investigation, the Democratic-controlled House voted almost entirely along party lines - 232 to 196 - to move the probe forward in Congress. The vote allows for public impeachment hearings in Congress, which are expected in the coming weeks, portending a bitter battle ahead as the United States heads into a presidential election year. Democrats who accuse Trump of abusing his office and jeopardizing national security for personal political gain were almost unanimous in approving Thursday’s measure, but they did not pick up a single Republican vote. “It’s a sad day. No one comes to Congress to impeach a president,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said before the vote. Televised public hearings featuring U.S. officials testifying in Congress about alleged wrongdoing by Trump could crowd out other issues like the economy and immigration as voters turn their minds to the November 2020 election. That might damage Trump, but some of his supporters say the impeachment drive could actually boost his re-election chances by showing him at loggerheads with Washington-based political foes. Republicans accused Democrats of using impeachment to overturn the results of his 2016 election victory. Trump told a UK radio station the Democrats knew they were losing next year’s vote and so were trying to take him down. “The Democrats are desperate, they’re desperate. They have nothing,” Trump told LBC Radio in an interview. White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham denounced the process as “unfair, unconstitutional and fundamentally un-American.” A number of opinion polls ahead of next year’s election show several leading Democratic presidential candidates leading Trump. The probe focuses on a July 25 telephone call in which the U.S. president asked his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymr Zelenskiy, to investigate Trump’s Democratic political rival Joe Biden, a former U.S. vice president, and his son Hunter, who had served as a director for Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Biden is a leading candidate in the Democratic presidential nomination race to face Trump in 2020. He and his son deny any wrongdoing. Trump has also denied wrongdoing. Republicans have largely stuck by him, blasting the impeachment push as a partisan exercise that has given them little input. Thursday’s vote showed that Democrats have enough backing in the House to later bring formal charges, known as articles of impeachment, if they feel they have enough evidence. REPUBLICAN PUSHBACK “It should not be Nancy Pelosi and a small group of people that she selects that get to determine who is going to be our president,” said Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican. Just two Democrats - Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey - broke with their party and voted against the measure. Both represent districts where Trump won in 2016. Other Democrats from Trump-leaning districts, such as Jared Golden of Maine, voted yes. Representative Justin Amash, who left the Republican Party this year and is now an independent, voted for the measure. If the House eventually votes to impeach Trump, that would set up a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate. Trump would not be removed from office unless the Senate votes to convict him by a two-thirds margin, something that looks unlikely as congressional Republicans have been reluctant to move against the president. The U.S. Constitution gives the House broad authority to set ground rules for an impeachment inquiry and Democrats say they are following House rules on investigations. The investigation is probing whether Trump misused the power of his office and, if so, whether that amounted to “high crimes and misdemeanors” that merit impeachment and removal from office under the Constitution. Democratic leaders in Congress declined to say when public hearings would start, but they are expected to begin in the next few weeks. The inquiry has so far taken place behind closed doors in front of House committee members. TESTIMONY Current and former Trump administration officials have testified that the White House went outside normal diplomatic channels to pressure Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens. The top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, William Taylor, said on Oct. 22 that Trump held back nearly $400 million in security aid in an attempt to get Zelenskiy to publicly declare that he would carry out the investigations that the U.S. president sought - a “quid pro quo” confirmed by Trump’s acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. On Thursday, lawmakers leading the inquiry heard closed-door testimony from Tim Morrison, the top Russia specialist on Trump’s National Security Council. Morrison resigned from his post on Wednesday. Morrison said he concurred with Taylor’s account of events, according to his statement seen by Reuters, lending additional credence to the allegations that Trump sought to pressure Zelenskiy. In his account, Taylor had said that Morrison described in an Aug. 1 telephone conversation how Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union and a White House point man on Ukraine, relayed to Andriy Yermak, a top Zelenskiy adviser, that the aid would be held up until Zelenskiy committed to an investigation into the Bidens. Taylor had also recalled a Sept. 7 conversation in which Morrison recounted to him a telephone exchange earlier that day between Trump and Sondland, in which Trump insisted Zelenskiy publicly announce opening a probe into the Bidens as well as a discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. election. Morrison did not criticize Trump directly, however, and said that he did not think anything illegal was discussed on the July 25 call, according to his statement. Committee members have asked a prominent player, former national security adviser John Bolton, to appear next week. Others have testified that Bolton was alarmed by a White House effort to pressure Zelenskiy. Bolton’s lawyer has said he is not willing to testify unless a subpoena is issued.",CR,,1,"A deeply divided U.S. House of Representatives took a major step on Thursday in the effort to impeach President Donald Trump when lawmakers approved rules for the next, more public, stage in the Democratic-led inquiry into Trump’s attempt to have Ukraine investigate a domestic political rival|Democrats who accuse Trump of abusing his office and jeopardizing national security for personal political gain were almost unanimous in approving Thursday’s measure, but they did not pick up a single Republican vote|.Republicans have largely stuck by him, blasting the impeachment push as a partisan exercise that has given them little input.",1,"A deeply divided U.S. House of Representatives took a major step on Thursday in the effort to impeach President Donald Trump when lawmakers approved rules for the next, more public, stage in the Democratic-led inquiry into Trump’s attempt to have Ukraine investigate a domestic political rival|The vote allows for public impeachment hearings in Congress, which are expected in the coming weeks, portending a bitter battle ahead as the United States heads into a presidential election year.|Democrats who accuse Trump of abusing his office and jeopardizing national security for personal political gain were almost unanimous in approving Thursday’s measure, but they did not pick up a single Republican vote.",1,"A deeply divided U.S. House of Representatives took a major step on Thursday in the effort to impeach President Donald Trump when lawmakers approved rules for the next, more public, stage in the Democratic-led inquiry into Trump’s attempt to have Ukraine investigate a domestic political rival.|The vote allows for public impeachment hearings in Congress, which are expected in the coming weeks, portending a bitter battle ahead as the United States heads into a presidential election year.|Democrats who accuse Trump of abusing his office and jeopardizing national security for personal political gain were almost unanimous in approving Thursday’s measure, but they did not pick up a single Republican vote."

Now, we may find out what Mueller was talking about. On Friday, as Trump and Republicans continued to attack the impeachment inquiry by House Democrats, Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., issued a decision that may have sealed Trump's fate. Howell ruled that the Department of Justice must provide Congress with the unredacted version of the Mueller report as well as the grand jury testimony and related materials. The unredacted information disclosed in the report could answer what did Trump know and when did he know it. Specifically, Howell’s ruling sets into motion a series of events that could reveal Trump knew in advance about the emails stolen by Russia and released by WikiLeaks in 2016 to harm Hillary Clinton. The events are the release of the unredacted Mueller report to Congress by October 30, the Roger Stone-WikiLeaks trial scheduled to begin on November 5, and the public impeachment inquiry hearings by the House that will start a week or so later. Collectively, these three events could show a pattern by Trump of seeking foreign assistance for his campaigns in 2016 and 2020, which is illegal and bolsters the impeachment inquiry. Remember, Congress never received the unredacted Mueller report with the grand jury testimony and related materials they are entitled to because Attorney General William Barr wrongly withheld it since Mueller submitted his report to Barr last April. Now Congress is about to get it and that could be the undoing of Trump.First, Howell’s decision not only requires that the redactions, grand jury testimony and underlying evidence in the Mueller report be released to the House Judiciary Committee by Oct. 30, but it also established that the impeachment inquiry is legitimate. “Tipping the scale even further toward disclosure is the public’s interest in a diligent and thorough investigation into, and in a final determination about, potentially impeachable conduct by the president described in the Mueller report,” Howell said. The Mueller report contains many redacted passages of interest, including possible references to a call between Trump and Stone about the release of emails by WikiLeaks that could confirm Michael Cohen’s testimony about it. Cohen alleged to the House Oversight Committee last March that Trump received a phone call from Stone between July 17 and 20, 2016, informing him that WikiLeaks was planning to release emails that would damage Hillary Clinton. By the end of that week, WikiLeaks posted thousands of emails stolen by Russia in an attempt to disrupt the Democratic National Convention and harm Clinton. In addition, the alleged call between Trump and Stone is likely to be addressed in the Stone-WikiLeaks trial scheduled to start in Washington on Nov. 5. Stone faces a seven-count indictment that includes one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements, and one count of witness tampering. The combination of the unredacted Mueller report and the Stone trial could confirm whether Trump knew about the release of the emails from Stone in advance. Finally, the House plans to begin public hearings into the impeachment inquiry about a week after the start of the Stone-WikiLeaks trial. The inquiry is focused on the call by Trump to Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky and the relationship between the release of military aid and the pressure to investigate Joe Biden. If the unredacted Mueller report and Stone trial reveal that Trump knew in advance that the stolen emails were going to be released, then it establishes a pattern by Trump of seeking foreign assistance to help his campaigns. That is illegal and thereby bolsters the investigation into his call to Zelensky. Such disclosures would further increase public support for Trump’s impeachment and removal from office. The combination of the facts, evidence, and public support would force many, if not most, Republicans to support Trump’s impeachment as well. The stretch between Halloween and Thanksgiving could bring the greatest threat to Trump to date with much to fear and little to be thankful for. It may well be the beginning of his impeachment and the end of his time in office.",VC,,1,"Specifically, Howell’s ruling sets into motion a series of events that could reveal Trump knew in advance about the emails stolen by Russia and released by WikiLeaks in 2016 to harm Hillary Clinton.||",1,"On Friday, as Trump and Republicans continued to attack the impeachment inquiry by House Democrats, Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., issued a decision that may have sealed Trump's fate.||",0,

Brenton Tarrant pleaded not guilty in June to 51 counts of murder and 39 of attempted murder following the attack in March on Muslims at al-Noor and Linwood mosques during Friday prayers. His lawyers had earlier requested that he be tried in New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland, and a hearing was convened for Thursday to hear their arguments. The courtroom’s public gallery was packed with survivors of the attacks, members of the victims’ families and senior police officers working the case. Some of those affected had strong views about whether the trial — which is expected to take at least six weeks — should be moved to Auckland, about 475 miles north of the city where the attacks happened, which would have made it difficult for many to attend all the court sessions."" But Shane Tait, one of Mr. Tarrant’s lawyers, told the judge that his client was withdrawing the request. Mr. Tarrant, dressed in prison garb, appeared in court via video link, rather than in person, as is common in procedural hearings in New Zealand. At the end of the hearing, just before the video link was cut, he cupped his hand around his mouth and yelled something — but his microphone had already been faded and the words were not discernible. Wasseim Alsati, who was shot in the attack along with his 4-year-old daughter, and is still walking with crutches, said outside court that he was pleased the trial would be held in Christchurch. He said that he, along with other survivors, had been prepared to travel to Auckland but was glad he would not have to. Still, he was upset to see Mr. Tarrant’s demeanor in the video link. “He was absolutely happy. Laughing, smiling, not even giving any respect to the courtroom and to the judge,” Mr. Alsati said. “This is really bad behavior, really unacceptable behavior.” After the hearing, relatives and survivors were left baffled outside the courtroom, where they had expected to hear arguments about the proposed change in venue, as court staff members explained the proceedings to them. In the months after Mr. Tarrant’s arrest, New Zealand’s court system was criticized by some of the victims’ families and their advocates because initial hearings were scheduled for Fridays, the sacred day for Muslims and the day of the week that the attack took place. The hearings were switched to Thursdays in recent months, after families complained. The Justice Ministry earlier said it had introduced new cultural and language services at the court house, including a prayer room, in response to feedback from the community. The judge, Cameron Mander, has also adjusted the potential trial date. The trial was initially set for May 2020, during Ramadan, the holy month of prayer and fasting for Muslims, and officials appeared not to have realized the conflict. The trial, which is expected to run at least six weeks, is now scheduled to begin on June 2. The scale of the Christchurch case is unprecedented in a country that has never tried a mass shooting of anywhere near this size, and it is expected to challenge the court system. Seating for court hearings will be in high demand, with dozens of survivors and victims’ relatives, and a large international news media contingent. Security risks will also confront the court; at a June hearing in Mr. Tarrant’s case, a man was charged after he played pro-Nazi music outside the court and confronted a survivor of the attacks. Mr. Tarrant’s guards at the prison in Auckland where he is being held, the country’s only maximum security facility, were embarrassed in August when they were forced to admit that he had sent letters to supporters from his cell. At least one, which was posted on the message board 4chan, contained a call for racist violence. New Zealand’s government said at the time that the letters of prisoners who held white supremacist views would be inspected by a specialist team. Christine Stevenson, the chief executive of New Zealand’s corrections department, said the agency had never managed a prisoner like Mr. Tarrant before and the risk he presented was “unprecedented.” ",CR,,0,||,1,"In the months after Mr. Tarrant’s arrest, New Zealand’s court system was criticized by some of the victims’ families and their advocates because initial hearings were scheduled for Fridays, the sacred day for Muslims and the day of the week that the attack took place.||",0,||

In back-to-back press conferences, Pelosi and McCarthy delivered starkly contrasting accounts of the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry, with both claiming their respective parties were fighting to protect the U.S. Constitution.Democrats are showing great patriotism,” Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday, praising Schiff, D-Calif., for his “dignity and statesmanship.” “This isn’t about politics or anything political, it’s about patriotism, it’s about honoring our oath of office, and upholding the Constitution.” She added: “This is something we do with a heavy heart. This is very prayerful, because impeachment is a divisive thing in our country.” Pelosi went on to accuse the president of “bribery,” citing Wednesday’s public hearing featuring what she called “devastating” witness testimony from State Department official George Kent and U.S. top diplomat in Ukraine Bill Taylor. “Bribery—and that is in the Constitution and attached to impeachment proceedings,” Pelosi said. “The bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a fake investigation into the election—that’s bribery.” When asked whether bribery would be included as an article of impeachment, Pelosi replied: “We haven’t even made a decision to impeach. That’s what the inquiry is about.” “I’m saying, [what] the president has admitted to as ‘perfect,’ is bribery,” Pelosi said. Minutes later, McCarthy, R-Calif., took the podium on the other side of the House, claiming it’s Republicans who are “standing up” for the Constitution. “Are they doing this for political purposes or are they standing for the Constitution?” McCarthy said. “They came to Congress to impeach the president.” McCarthy went on to blast Schiff, claiming he “has continued to lie to the American public.”McCarthy outlined several instances where he believed Schiff had lied—including during the congressional Russia probe and when he “on purpose” delivered a parody reading last month of the transcript of Trump’s now-infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, which is at the center of the impeachment inquiry. That phone call prompted a whistleblower complaint to the Intelligence Community inspector general, and in turn, the impeachment inquiry in the House. On the call, Trump pressed Zelensky to open an investigation into Ukrainian election meddling in the 2016 presidential race and into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine. The president’s request came after millions in U.S. military aid to Ukraine had been frozen, which Democrats and witnesses have cited as a quid pro quo arrangement. Zelensky, though, has said he felt no pressure during the call. The White House has maintained no wrongdoing, and the president has repeatedly said the call was “perfect,” arguing that it contained “no quid pro quo.” McCarthy also said that Schiff “lied again” when he claimed during the public hearing on Wednesday that he “didn’t know who the whistleblower was.” “His staff met with the whistleblower, he can claim he did not. They met with the whistleblower before the whistleblower had an attorney and before the whistleblower went to the inspector general,” McCarthy explained. “When he went, you know that the whistleblower did not say that he met with Schiff’s staff.” Fox News reported last month that the whistleblower did not disclose contact with Schiff’s staff to the intelligence committee inspector general (ICIG). Schiff’s office acknowledged that the whistleblower had reached out to them before filing a complaint in mid-August, giving Democrats advance warning of the accusations that would lead them to launch an impeachment inquiry days later. During his attack of Schiff, McCarthy said he does “not think that Schiff is fit to be in the position to run the Intelligence Committee.” “And yes, I do believe Schiff has spent his entire time in Congress, since the president has been in, trying to impeach him,” McCarthy said. “He’s already written the script and he’s trying to fill it in—he’s been auditioning witnesses in the basement.” Meanwhile, up next on Friday in the public phase of the impeachment inquiry is former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovich, with a number of other hearings with current and former top officials scheduled for next week.",VC,,1,"McCarthy brands Schiff a liar, Pelosi accuses Trump of bribery as impeachment war heats up|House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy blasted Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff as a serial liar on Thursday, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused President Trump of bribery -- as the political war on Capitol Hill escalated alongside the launch of impeachment hearings.|McCarthy went on to blast Schiff, claiming he “has continued to lie to the American public.”",1,"McCarthy brands Schiff a liar, Pelosi accuses Trump of bribery as impeachment war heats up|House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy blasted Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff as a serial liar on Thursday, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused President Trump of bribery -- as the political war on Capitol Hill escalated alongside the launch of impeachment hearings.|In back-to-back press conferences, Pelosi and McCarthy delivered starkly contrasting accounts of the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry, with both claiming their respective parties were fighting to protect the U.S. Constitution.",1,"McCarthy brands Schiff a liar, Pelosi accuses Trump of bribery as impeachment war heats up|House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy blasted Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff as a serial liar on Thursday, while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused President Trump of bribery -- as the political war on Capitol Hill escalated alongside the launch of impeachment hearings.|In back-to-back press conferences, Pelosi and McCarthy delivered starkly contrasting accounts of the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry, with both claiming their respective parties were fighting to protect the U.S. Constitution."

The teen is scheduled to appear in court Saturday to face two counts of attempted first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated battery in the shooting, which also left a man wounded. The girl, dressed as a bumble bee, was trick-or-treating with her family around 5:30 p.m. Thursday in the Little Village neighborhood when a group of men chasing another man began shooting, Chicago police Sgt. Rocco Alioto told reporters. The child was shot in the lower neck, police said, and is in critical condition at Stroger Hospital. A 31-year-old man also was shot in the incident. He was in stable condition Thursday night after being transported to Mount Sinai Hospital with a gunshot wound to his left hand, police said. There is no relationship between the victims, police said. The child is ""fighting for her life,"" Alioto said Thursday. ""This is unacceptable. It's a 7-year-old girl that's trick-or-treating with her family out here and happens to get shot because a group of guys want to shoot at another male while there is a street full of kids trick-or-treating,"" Alioto said. Police believe the shooting was the result of a dispute between two gangs and multiple offenders were involved, but police do not have an exact number, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said. The shooter wore a ""Jason"" mask from the ""Friday the 13th"" movie, he said. Detectives recovered a firearm that may be connected to the shooting, Chicago police chief communications officer Anthony Guglielmi said via Twitter. Johnson called the shooting ""reprehensible"" and those behind it ""cowards"" during a news conference Friday announcing historic lows in the number of homicides and shootings during October in the city. ""None of that matters if parents that live in certain communities can't even take their children out on Halloween,"" he said.",CR,,0,||,0,||,0,||

The judge's order came just days after a jury rendered a verdict giving the mother sole conservatorship of the child. In her ruling, Judge Kim Cooks said a ""substantial change in circumstances with child or parent,"" warranted her decision to award joint custody.The child was considered to be male at birth. The mother, pediatrician Anne Georgulas, has argued the child is a transgender girl. The father, Jeffrey Younger, maintains the child is a boy. CNN is not naming the 7-year-old to protect the child's privacy. In 2018, Georgulas filed a lawsuit seeking to modify her custody agreement with Younger. She wanted Younger to affirm the child with a girl's name inside and outside the home, among other requests essentially forcing the father to embrace the child's gender expressions. Judge Kim Cooks ultimately denied the request, saying Friday that ""the Court finds that the State of Texas has no compelling interest to justify such interference."" But the judge ruled that Georgulas did not make a request to be appointed sole managing conservator, nor did she make a request to surgically or chemically transition the child's sex or chemically castrate the child. Younger has previously accused Georgulas of wanting to medically transition the child. The judge also ruled that ""there has been no abuse, neglect, or family violence by either parent,"" but she also ordered the father and mother to each attend family counseling with the child and the child's twin, a boy. And the judge placed a ""permanent injunction"" on the parents, preventing them from talking about the case to the media. This essentially shuts down Younger's efforts to publicize the case by creating a blog and taking part in many media interviews. The judge ruled that the child ""appears comfortable as a male, female, or gender nonspecific."" The judge's decision, issued Thursday, means that both parents will have a say in any medical decisions involving their child's gender. Governor, senator weigh in The case became a political flashpoint after Younger started a website about the case, received donations of about $139,000, and allowed media to interview him and the child, court documents say. The website is no longer live. The case drew reaction from Gov. Greg Abbott and US Sen. Ted Cruz, both Republicans. In response to the jury's Monday decision to grant Georgulas sole custody, Cruz tweeted: ""A 7-year-old child doesn't have the maturity to make profound decisions like this. The state of Texas should protect this child's right to choose — as an informed, mature person — and not be used as a pawn in a left-wing political agenda.""Abbott also tweeted that the Texas Attorney General's Office and the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services were looking into the case. A day before the judge issued her ruling, First Assistant Attorney General Jeff Mateer sent a letter to the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services to investigate Younger's claims of abuse. Marissa Gonzales, a spokesperson with the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, said the department ""has begun investigating the allegations,"" responding to the letter sent by the attorney general on Thursday. "" CNN has reached out to both Cruz and Abbott for their reaction to the judge's ruling on Thursday. The American Academy of Pediatrics says that by around age 2, children typically become aware of physical differences between boys and girls. By 3, most can easily identify themselves as one or the other. By 4, ""Most children have a stable sense of their gender identity,"" the AAP says on its Healthy Children website. Judge cites father's 'initially valid concerns' ""The Court finds that the Father may have initially had valid concerns regarding his children and the Mother making crucial decisions without his input,"" the ruling said. ""However, the Court finds that the Father finds comfort in public controversy and attention surrounded by the use of unfounded facts and is thus motivated by the financial gain of approximately $139,000 he has received at the cost of the protection and privacy of his children."" Jeffrey Younger, the father, said he thinks it is ""more important for the public to know what's going on with the court than have his child live a private life."" Lawyers for Georgulas and Younger did not return CNN requests for comment. The judge's ruling also said both parents must agree on topics like medication, surgical and psychological treatment. A parenting coordinator was appointed to the family, according to court documents.",VC,,1,"A custody battle between parents who disagree on the gender of their 7-year-old draws attention of Texas politicians|In response to the jury's Monday decision to grant Georgulas sole custody, Cruz tweeted: ""A 7-year-old child doesn't have the maturity to make profound decisions like this.

Saginaw has 48,000 people, and from 2010 to 2018 it lost 6% of its population. Fifty-five percent of people are working, and nearly 34% are living in poverty. Like many other cities on this list, it used to have a lot of manufacturing jobs — at one point about 25,000 with General Motors. But they didn't last. Some locals reportedly refer to the city as ""sag-nasty"" because of its issues with crime. In May 2019, violent crime had fallen in the city, with 16 shootings to date, compared with 30 at that point in 2018. 30. Plainfield, New Jersey Plainfield, New Jersey in 2018.

Joe Skipper / Reuters Miami Gardens has 113,000 people — 60% are working, while about 22% live in poverty. In 2014, it was called the ""stop and frisk capital of America,"" after an investigation showed nearly 57,000 people had been frisked since 2008. Another issue in the area is the cost of water. Because it comes from a plant owned by the City of North Miami Beach, the cost of living is a little bit higher. In March, the city was suing to fight the extra 25% surcharge. 27. Cleveland A city demolition sub-contractor works on the extraction of a vacant home on February 2, 2012 in Cleveland, OH.

Just over half of its population is working, and nearly 37% of its people live in poverty. It used to have a population of 170,000 and was the third-biggest steel producer in the United States, until the factory began downsizing in 1977. It was also recorded as having some of the worst air pollution in Ohio in 2017. 25.

One of the big issues it faces is flooding, even when it doesn't rain. Sometimes, all that's necessary for flooding is a full moon. It is also facing problems around septic tanks (the city has 2,780) that soon might not be able to operate properly because of rising sea levels. This could result in wastewater ending up in yards and other places it's not meant to be. 24. Huntington, West Virginia Dilapidated houses are seen in Huntington, West Virginia, U.S. May 4, 2017.

Just over half are working, and about a third live in poverty. A thriving coal town with 90,000 people in 1950, it has since fallen on harder times. In 2008, the city was described as the unhealthiest in America. The opioid crisis has led Huntington to be named America's overdose capital. But overdoses have fallen since 2017. 23.

The city, which is located near two freeways and close to Los Angeles, had a lot of revenue coming in from car dealerships, but it struggled during the recession when three dealerships closed, and the city's tax revenue fell. It's continued to have issues with finances, and the city is now divided over the future of marijuana production, and one large facility in particular. 21. Lynwood, California Hon. Judge Paul A.

The construction of Interstate 105, which cut right through the city, caused many to leave their homes and 1,000 homes and businesses to be knocked down. More recently, officials have struggled to manage the city's finances, resulting in losses that could have been used to help the city. 20.

Richard Carson / Reuters Huntsville has 41,500 residents; 39% of its people are working, and almost 35% live in poverty. The low employment, however, is in part because those living in prisons are counted in the city's population. The Department of Criminal Justice is the city's biggest employer, providing nearly 7,000 jobs. Since 1999, Texas' executions have been done exclusively out of Huntsville. 19.

By 1990, General Motors had downsized in the area, leaving many without jobs. Flint is perhaps best known for the water crisis it's been facing since 2014, where residents were being poisoned with lead. On top of that, it's got 20,000 abandoned properties to deal with, a consistently high murder rate, and an opioid problem. 6. Pine Bluff, Arkansas Pine Bluff, Arkansas in 2011.

The bombshell claim by Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner who has worked on high-profile cases during a five-decade medical career, is certain to reignite suspicions that surfaced immediately after Epstein, who was awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges involving underage girls, was discovered dead in his cell on Aug. 10. Baden, who was hired by Epstein’s brother and observed the autopsy, told Fox News its findings are more consistent with homicidal strangulation than suicidal hanging. He noted that the 66-year-old Epstein had two fractures on the left and right sides of his larynx, specifically the thyroid cartilage or Adam’s apple, as well as one fracture on the left hyoid bone above the Adam’s apple, Baden told Fox News. “Those three fractures are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation,” Baden, who is also a Fox News contributor, said. While there’s not enough information to be conclusive yet, the three fractures were “rare,” said Baden, who's probed cases involving O.J. Simpson, President John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, record producer Phil Spector, New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez and many others. “I’ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case,” the 85-year-old medical legend told Fox News. Baden, who's examined more than 20,000 bodies and hosted HBO's ""Autopsy,"" explained that if a person weighed 120 pounds and their head weighed 10 pounds, there would be 110 pounds of pressure on the neck at the jaw during a hanging. But, if someone put a hand around a person's neck and squeezed, that could double or even triple the pressure on the neck, Baden said. There were also hemorrhages in Epstein’s eyes that were common in homicidal strangulation and uncommon, though not unheard of, in suicidal hangings, the forensic pathologist said. “The prominent hemorrhage in the soft tissues of the neck next to the fractures is evidence of a fresh neck compression that could have caused the death,” Baden said. Baden stressed his independent study was not complete. “The investigation is not completed until all the information has come in,” he said. Epstein was found hanging in his prison cell at the high-security Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan and was later declared dead, investigators said. Prosecutors alleged that the previously convicted sex offender paid girls as young as 14 hundreds of dollars for massages before he molested them in his homes in New York and Palm Beach, Fla., between 2002 and 2005. He was awaiting trial in federal prison, thus federal agencies -- presumably the FBI and Justice Department -- had jurisdiction over the investigation into his death, Baden explained. He said it was unknown to him and the Epstein family what work the feds may have done and what results they might have. The ligature, or item used to tie something tightly, allegedly was made from a sheet that had been twisted and put around Epstein’s neck, Baden said. Evidence on the cloth material could help prove whether or not someone else was involved in Epstein's death. “Whoever it is would have their DNA all over the ligature,” he said. “We don’t have those results yet,” he added, saying those results “should be reported quickly to give an idea and lessen the speculation.” New York City Medical Examiner Barbara Sampson ruled Epstein’s cause of death to be a suicide by hanging. “It appears that this could have been a mistake,” Baden said. “There’s evidence here of homicide that should be investigated, to see if it is or isn’t homicide.” But Sampson on Wednesday is standing by her findings. “Our investigation concluded that the cause of Mr. Epstein’s death was hanging and the manner of death was suicide. We stand by that determination,"" she told Fox News in a statement. ""We continue to share information around the medical investigation with Mr. Epstein's family, their representatives, and their pathology consultant. ""The original medical investigation was thorough and complete,"" she continued, adding that ""there is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office.” Epstein previously was discovered on July 23 -- over two weeks before his death -- on the floor of his prison cell with marks around his neck, after which he was placed on suicide watch. He was taken off suicide watch a week later and put in another cell with a roommate, Baden said -- but the second inmate was taken out a few days after that, leaving Epstein alone in the cell. On the day Epstein was found dead, the prison security had experienced a “total breakdown” in procedure, according to Baden. On the day Epstein was found dead, the prison security had experienced a “total breakdown” in procedure, according to Baden. “It was determined that the two guards who were supposed to be working in that area of the prison had allegedly fallen asleep and hadn’t made their 30-minute rounds for more than 3 hours,” he said. Then there were security cameras that were supposed to be recording the cell and the hallway outside, to see who went in and out. Both apparently had malfunctioned, according to Baden. Mark Epstein, Jeffrey’s next of kin, had hired Baden to perform an independent investigation because the family wasn’t getting answers -- and if his brother’s death was, in fact, a homicide, “he and others may be at risk,” Baden said, “because of somebody not wanting knowledge given out.” Through his five decades of experience, Epstein’s death is not straightforward, Baden said. “It doesn’t give you the answer,"" he said. ""It's not a typical hanging case.”",CR,,0,,0,,0,

The question is: Does the company know that? The Atlanta-based company seemingly forgot when it sent out an email to loyalty program members this week gearing up for the made-up holiday held on Nov. 3, according to USA Today. ""Calling all sandwich lovers,"" the email reads in part. ""Some prefer it grilled, others fancy the original. No matter which Chick-fil-A sandwich you love, order yours on Nov. 3 for National Sandwich Day."" Problem is, Nov. 3 is a Sunday, the one day each week that Chick-fil-A restaurants are closed. Days later, the chain followed up with an email poking fun at itself in owning up to the mishap, the outlet reported. The subject of the email: ""Well ... this is awkward."" ""We recently sent an email that included a message about National Sandwich Day, which naturally we were very excited about,"" the email read in part. ""We didn’t realize it falls on Sunday, when we are closed. We apologize for the confusion and hope to see you soon (Monday-Saturday)."" Chick-fil-A did not immediately respond to FOX Business' request for comment. In 1946, founder Truett Cathy made the decision to close the chain on Sundays so that ""he and his employees could set aside one day to rest and worship if they choose"" -- a practice which is still maintained today. Chick-fil-A's e-mail gaffe comes around the same time that rival Popeyes reminded fans that its highly-regarded chicken sandwich, unavailable for months, is ""officially BACK nationwide on Sunday, Nov. 3."" The chain sold out of the sandwiches about two weeks after launching them in August, an addition that rattled the hierarchy of the existing market and left even more people beefing over chicken on social media.",CR,,0,||,0,||,0,||

Fiona Hill told House investigators she came to realize Ambassador Gordon Sondland wasn’t simply operating outside official diplomatic channels, as she and others suspected, but carrying out instructions from Trump. “He was being involved in a domestic political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy,"" she testified, “and those two things had just diverged.” Hill’s comment followed a blistering back-and-forth during questioning from Republicans at the House hearing. Testimony from Hill and David Holmes, a State Department adviser in Kyiv, capped an intense week in the historic inquiry and reinforced the central complaint: that Trump used foreign policy for political aims, setting off alarms across the U.S. national security and foreign policy apparatus. Democrats allege Trump was relying on the discredited idea that Ukraine rather than Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election as he sought investigations in return for two things: U.S. military aid that Ukraine needed to fend off Russian aggression, and a White House visit the new Ukrainian president wanted that would demonstrate his backing from the West. One by one, Hill, a Russia expert at the White House’s National Security Council until this summer, took on Trump’s defenses. She and Holmes both told House investigators it was abundantly clear Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani was pursuing political investigations of Democrats and Joe Biden in Ukraine. “He was clearly pushing forward issues and ideas that would, you know, probably come back to haunt us and in fact,” Hill testified. “I think that's where we are today."" And Hill stood up for Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the Army officer who testified earlier and whom Trump’s allies tried to discredit.” He remains at the White House National Security Council. At one point, Republicans interjected, trying to cut off Hill’s response as she flipped the script during the afternoon of questioning. The GOP lawmakers had been trying to highlight her differences with Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union who delivered damaging testimony Wednesday about what he said was Trump’s “quid pro quo” pursuit of the political investigations. The Republican lawmakers eventually wound down their questions but continued with mini-speeches decrying the impeachment effort. Democrats, in turn, criticized Trump’s actions. Hill, a former aide to then-national security adviser John Bolton, sternly warned Republican lawmakers — and implicitly Trump — to quit pushing a “fictional” narrative that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in U.S. elections. Trump has told others testifying in the inquiry that Ukraine tried to “take me down” in the 2016 election. Republicans launched their questioning Thursday reviving those theories. Hill declared: “I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternative narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U.S. adversary, and that Ukraine — not Russia — attacked us in 2016.” Her testimony also raised fresh questions whether Bolton, who has yet to defy White House orders for officials not to testify, would appear in the inquiry. In what was seen as a nudge to her former boss, Hill said those with information have a “moral obligation to provide it.” The landmark House impeachment inquiry was sparked by a July 25 phone call, in which Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for investigations into Biden and the Democratic National Committee. A still-anonymous whistleblower’s official government complaint about that call led the House to launch the current probe. Hill and Holmes both filled in gaps in previous testimony and poked holes in the accounts of other witnesses. They were particularly adamant that efforts by Trump and Giuliani to investigate the Burisma company were well-known by officials working on Ukraine to be the equivalent of probing the Bidens. That runs counter to earlier testimony from Sondland and Kurt Volker, the former Ukraine special envoy, who insisted they had no idea there was a connection. Holmes, a late addition to the schedule, also undercut some of Sondland’s recollections about an extraordinary phone call between the ambassador and Trump on July 26, the day after the president’s call with Ukraine. Holmes was having lunch with Sondland in Kyiv and said he could overhear Trump ask about “investigations” during a “colorful” conversation. After the phone call, Holmes said Sondland told him Trump cared about “big stuff,” including the investigation into the “Biden investigation.” Sondland said he didn’t recall raising the Bidens. During Thursday’s testimony, the president tweeted that while his own hearing is “great” he’s never been able to understand another person’s conversation that wasn’t on speaker. “Try it,” he suggested. Holmes also testified about his growing concern as Giuliani orchestrated Ukraine policy outside official diplomatic channels. It was a concern shared by others, he testified. “My recollection is that Ambassador Sondland stated, “Every time Rudy gets involved he goes and f---s everything up.” Holmes testified that he grew alarmed throughout the year, watching as Giuliani was “making frequent public statements pushing for Ukraine to investigate interference in the 2016 election and issues related to Burisma and the Bidens.” Hill left the White House before the July phone call that sparked the impeachment probe, though she was part of other key meetings and conversations related to Ukraine policy. She opened her testimony with an impassioned plea for Republicans to stop peddling an alternative theory of 2016 election interference and helping Russia sow divisions in the United States. “This is exactly what the Russian government was hoping for,” she said about the currently American political climate. “They would pit one side of our electorate against the others.” She warned that Russia is gearing up to intervene again in the 2020 U.S. election. “We are running out of time to stop them,” she testified. Trump — as well as Republicans on the panel, including ranking GOP Rep. Devin Nunes of California — continue to advance the idea that Russian interference was a “hoax,” and that it was Ukraine that was trying to swing the election, to stop Trump’s presidency. “That is the Democrats’ pitiful legacy,” Nunes said in his opening remarks. He called it all part of the same effort, from “the Russia hoax” to the “shoddy sequel” of the impeachment inquiry. Hill, who became a U.S. citizen in 2002, told lawmakers she was the daughter of a coal miner in the northeast of England, noting it is the same region George Washington’s ancestors came from. Hill said Bolton told her separately he didn’t want to be involved in any “drug deal” Sondland and Trump’s acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney were cooking up over the Ukrainian investigations Trump wanted. In Moscow on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was pleased that the “political battles” in Washington had overtaken the Russia allegations, which are supported by the U.S. intelligence agencies. ""Thank God,” Putin said, “no one is accusing us of interfering in the U.S. elections anymore. Now they’re accusing Ukraine.""",CR,,0,||,1,"At one point, Republicans interjected, trying to cut off Hill’s response as she flipped the script during the afternoon of questioning.|Hill, a former aide to then-national security adviser John Bolton, sternly warned Republican lawmakers — and implicitly Trump — to quit pushing a “fictional” narrative that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in U.S. elections.| “This is exactly what the Russian government was hoping for,” she said about the currently American political climate. “They would pit one side of our electorate against the others.”",1,"“This is exactly what the Russian government was hoping for,” she said about the currently American political climate. “They would pit one side of our electorate against the others.”|“That is the Democrats’ pitiful legacy,” Nunes said in his opening remarks.|"

That's according to a study published in the journal Health Affairs on Monday. The study examined child mortality rates between 1961 and 2010 in the US and comparable nations in the OECD, a group of 35 countries, founded to improve economic development and social well-being around the world. It found that mortality rates were not evenly distributed. ""This study should alarm everyone. The US is the most dangerous of wealthy, democratic countries in the world for children,"" said Dr. Ashish Thakrar, lead author of the study and an internal medicine resident at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Health System in Baltimore. ""We were surprised by how far the US has fallen behind other wealthy countries,"" he said. ""Across all ages and in both sexes, children have been dying more often in the US than in similar countries since the 1980s."" Some of the factors driving America's child mortality rate were related to infant deaths, automobile accidents and firearm assaults, according to the study. Why the US has worst child mortality Researchers analyzed data on mortality rates for children up to age 19 in the US, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The data, which dated from 1961 to 2010, came from the Human Mortality Database and the World Health Organization's Mortality Database. The researchers found that childhood mortality rates declined gradually from 1961 to 2010 for the US and the 19 other nations, which was a big success for public health. Yet the US rate fell at a slower pace than the other nations over those 50 years. Specifically, during the decade from 2001 to 2010, the researchers found that the mortality rate in the United States was about 75% higher for infants and about 50% higher for children ages 1 to 19 than the average rate calculated for all of the countries in the study. During that decade, other countries with infant mortality rates also above the overall average included Switzerland, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. Those with child mortality rates above the overall average were Ireland, Austria and Canada. New Zealand's child mortality rate was also significantly higher than average, similar to that of the US. Thakrar said the difference in the two nations' rates was not ""statistically meaningful."" Countries with infant mortality rates below the overall average included Sweden, Spain, Norway, Japan, Iceland and Finland. Those with child mortality rates below the overall average included Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Japan, Italy, Iceland, Germany and Denmark. Overall, for children of all ages between 1961 and 2010, Sweden had the lowest child mortality rate among all of the countries. As for America, ""we found that excess deaths in the US are concentrated among infants, from causes such as immaturity and SIDS, and among teens, from injuries,"" Thakrar said. ""Existing research has shown that infants die more frequently in the US, but this was the first time we were able to see that this trend started decades ago. We were also surprised by how much more often US adolescents, in particular boys, are dying from injuries,"" he said. ""The most disturbing new finding of this study was that a 15- to 19-year-old in the US is 82 times more likely to die from gun violence in the US than in any other wealthy, democratic nation."" The researchers wrote in the study's abstract that policy interventions could help to reverse these mortality rates in the US, such as by aiming to reduce the number of automobile accidents, assaults by firearm and infant deaths across the country. The study had some limitations. For instance, reporting, coding and classifications systems for death counts and cause-of-death data vary across countries. Those systems also have changed over the 50-year period analyzed in the study. Thakrar added that the study's data did not include demographic information, so the researchers were unable to examine disparities within US mortality rates. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report last week showing state-by-state and racial disparities in infant mortality rates, with Mississippi having the highest and Massachusetts having the lowest rate from 2013 through 2015. 'The future of any country is its children' There are just a few mortality-specific causes that help explain the discrepancies between the US and other countries, said Lindsay Stark, an associate professor of population and family health at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. ""There were no major differences between the US and other countries in terms of infectious disease or cardiovascular disease, for example. The main reason the US is lagging behind other nations is because of perinatal mortality, including maternal conditions affecting a fetus or newborn, and injuries, mostly due to firearms,"" Stark said. ""What these findings clearly show is that there are areas where the US could be preventing child deaths, and we are failing to do so -- due to gaps in public policy, a weak social safety net and persisting social disparities that affect families', mothers' and children's health unequally,"" she said. ""The future of any country is its children, so at a fundamental level, we can see a country's investment in its future in the way children are surviving and thriving."" Thakrar agreed that many of the deaths behind the high mortality rates in the US are preventable. ""To turn around these trends, we will need to think beyond medical care to address the social environment children live in,"" Thakrar said. ""Every child deserves the opportunity to live a full, healthy and safe life. These findings show that we are not living up to that promise and that we have fallen short of that promise for the last 30 years.""",CR,,0,||,0,||,0,||

But now, those age-old fights are changing. What was once run-of-the-mill partisan competition is being replaced by a disagreement over democracy itself. This is particularly evident as the president and many of his allies crow about the illegitimacy of the House impeachment inquiry, calling it an attempted coup, and as the White House refuses to comply with multiple congressional subpoenas as part of the probe. This marks a new phase in American politics. Democrats and Republicans might still disagree about policy, but they are increasingly also at odds over the very foundations of our constitutional order. Political scientists have a term for what the United States is witnessing right now. It’s called “regime cleavage,” a division within the population marked by conflict about the foundations of the governing system itself—in the American case, our constitutional democracy. In societies facing a regime cleavage, a growing number of citizens and officials believe that norms, institutions and laws may be ignored, subverted or replaced. And there are serious consequences: An emerging regime cleavage in the United States brought on by President Donald Trump and his defenders could signal that the American public might lose faith in the electoral process altogether or incentivize elected politicians to mount even more direct attacks on the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers. Regime cleavages emerge only in governing systems in crisis, and our democracy is indeed in crisis. Just look at the hardening split among the American people on impeachment: The fraction of citizens who oppose the impeachment inquiry is the same as that who approve of the president, signifying that partisan disagreement over policy has turned into a partisan divide over political legitimacy. This cleavage shows up in discourse across the American political spectrum that labels one’s political opponents as un-American, disloyal, even treasonous. But it is clearest in the argument that it would amount to a “coup” to remove the president via conviction in the Senate, and thus that the regular functioning of the legislative branch would be illegitimate. These divisions are over the laws that set out plainly in our Constitution how the president can be subject to sanction. Regime cleavages are different from other political “cleavages.” Conflict between left and right, for example, over issues such as taxation and redistribution, is healthy. Other cleavages are based on identity, such as racial conflict in South Africa, or religious divides between Hindus and Muslims in India or Protestants and Catholics during the past century in the Netherlands. Identity cleavages can be dangerous, but they are common across the world’s democracies and can be endured, just so long as different groups respect the rule of law and the legitimacy of the electoral process. Regime cleavages, by contrast, focus the electorate’s attention on the political system as a whole. Instead of seeking office to change the laws to obtain preferred policies, politicians who oppose the democratic order ignore the laws when necessary to achieve their political goals, and their supporters stand by or even endorse those means to their desired ends. Today, when Trump refuses to comply with the House impeachment inquiry, he makes plain his indifference to the Constitution and to the separation of powers. When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell argues that impeachment overturns an election result, he is doing the same. In the minds of Trump, his allies and, increasingly, his supporters, it’s not just Democrats but American democracy that is the obstacle. As Harvard political scientists Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt have argued, democracy can manage political conflict only if citizens and politicians allow the institutions of democracy—elections, representative bodies, the judiciary—to do so. Parties and politicians must not be rewarded for refusing to adhere to laws and institutions. Decades ago, a regime cleavage divided Chileans, with conservatives aligning against the elected government of Salvador Allende and eventually leading to a coup that replaced him with General Augusto Pinochet. The United States has confronted a regime cleavage, too: The last emerged in the 1850s, prior to the Civil War, when many in the slave states began to advocate secession—a clear challenge to the legitimacy of the Union. Growing fights over executive power can mark an emerging regime cleavage in a democracy like ours. One side will hold that “democracy” means empowering the executive and freeing him or her from the strictures of legislative and judicial accountability (in other words, a hollow democracy, one in name only in which executive authority is bound only by the whims of those in power). The other will hold that democracy means strengthening other institutions in order to hold the executive branch to account. This, in turn, creates a form of outbidding: Even if Democrats oppose an unfettered executive now, they will have every incentive to use whatever presidential powers are available to them when they do hold the White House. This has already begun to happen in the U.S. to some extent: Competition over an unconstrained executive branch, of course, motivated Republicans to oppose President Barack Obama, who also capitalized on the long-term increase in executive authority in the United States. The academic term for this sort of seesaw electoral politics is “democratic careening.” Politics becomes no longer about who delivers the best policy or who best represents voters’ ideals, but rather who can control the executive and how far they can push the limits of the rule of law. But what distinguishes the current moment under Trump from the normal, albeit worsening, politics of executive-legislative relations in the United States is the politicization of the very notion of executive constraint in the face of an impeachment hearing—this is the source of the regime cleavage. American politics is not yet fully consumed by this current, emerging regime cleavage. But if it continues without a forceful, bipartisan rebuke, we can expect that politics in the United States will increasingly come to be characterized by the kinds of intractable conflicts between populist outsiders, old-guard politicians, and the machinery of the state that have characterized presidential democracies in countries like Argentina and, more recently, Taiwan. Our regime cleavage has not yet hardened to the extent that it has in these countries, but if it does, it will not be possible to elect a president who can “end the mess in Washington” because both sides of the regime cleavage will argue that the other is illegitimate and undemocratic. Voters, understandably, will lose what faith they have left in the value of democracy itself. In the worst-case scenario, presidents and their supporters would be entirely unaccountable to Congress, while their opponents would reject the legitimacy of the presidency altogether. Even worse: What if Trump refuses to acknowledge defeat by a Democratic opponent in 2020? What would happen in that case? Might the president’s supporters resort to violence? Might broad segments of the GOP simply refuse to recognize an elected Democratic executive as well? Protecting the rule of law, defending the separation of powers and restoring constitutional order to Washington increasingly seem as though they will require the impeachment, conviction and removal from office of the current president. At the very least, Americans of every political persuasion must demand that the administration take part in the impeachment proceedings, even if the Republicans in the Senate ultimately weigh partisanship over evidence in their vote. So long as the executive and legislative branches respect the procedures and powers outlined in the Constitution, we must all respect their legitimacy—regardless of the outcome. If we fail to agree on and abide by our common democratic principles, our emerging regime cleavage will harden, and the future for American democracy will be bleak.",CR,,1,"Democrats and Republicans might still disagree about policy, but they are increasingly also at odds over the very foundations of our constitutional order.|But what distinguishes the current moment under Trump from the normal, albeit worsening, politics of executive-legislative relations in the United States is the politicization of the very notion of executive constraint in the face of an impeachment hearing—this is the source of the regime cleavage|",1,"For decades, Republicans and Democrats fought over the same things: whose values and policies work best for American democracy.

The heavy-handed and characteristic blend of implied pressure and hinted-at quid pro quos that Trump deployed in the conversation -- that he first perfected as a real estate shark and then took to the White House -- now threatens to work against him. On stage at a New York news conference Wednesday, Trump, offered moral support by his Cabinet lieutenants Mike Pompeo and Steven Mnuchin, seemed embittered, lonely and a little confused. The behavior that he has always trusted to help him come out on top, with its obfuscation, bullying, fact-bending and conspiracy spinning tangents, suddenly didn't seem to be working. It was the same story for Rudy Giuliani, whose unchained appearances on television that Trump so prizes seemed to dig the President in deeper. And in the latest blockbuster revelation, a whistleblower complaint on Trump and Ukraine released Thursday morning accused the President of using his power ""to solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 election. White House officials, the whistleblower said, were ""deeply disturbed"" by Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. The officials attempted to ""lock down"" all records of the phone call, especially the word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced by the White House, the complaint states. There has long been a gap between Trump's conduct and the conventions of the office of the presidency. His success with his supporters has often rested in his willingness to so publicly flout such standards. But now it appears, that his unorthodox methods may have caught up with him. Many observers, like fired former FBI Director James Comey, have noted that Trump's way of doing business and demands for loyalty have similarities with the loaded language of a mafia don. The President's jailed former lawyer Michael Cohen was familiar with the approach Trump exhibited in his dealings with Ukraine. ""He doesn't give you questions, he doesn't give you orders, he speaks in a code. And I understand the code, because I've been around him for a decade,"" Cohen said in congressional testimony in February. But finally Trump, an expert on creating his own reality, may have been undone by facts on a page that he released himself, handing Democrats a clear, apparently prosecutable case, that suggests abuse of power with the transcript of the call with Zelensky. Trump is in new territory now. Building blocks of impeachment Wednesday was another tempestuous day in Washington, where an impeachment drive picked up stunning speed, and in the city where Trump made his legend and desperately fought to save it. It started with growing suspicions that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi got too far over her skis by launching impeachment hearings on Tuesday before seeing the call transcript or details of a whistleblower complaint on the same issue against Trump. But it ended with Democrats increasingly convinced they had the building blocks of a case against the President -- one that will pitch the nation into a long, dark political tunnel. Looking back, it now seems impossible that the President thought releasing the transcript would get him out of his jam. While it did not contain the direct quid pro quo of a threat to halt military aid unless Zelensky launched a probe against Joe Biden, it came perilously close to one. The distasteful spectacle of a President of a democratic superpower leaning on the rookie leader of a vulnerable post-Soviet state leaped off the page. Trump had long been scheduled to meet Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. In the light of events, their photo-op took on a surreal turn. Zelensky made sure to supply the soundbite that Trump had hoped for. ""There was no pressure,"" he said, before the US leader quickly jumped in to make sure no one missed the moment. ""You know there was no pressure,"" he said, turning to reporters. ""I appreciate the answer."" In a news conference punctuated by angry swipes at reporters later on, the President didn't have a very organized defense, suggesting that his underpowered White House may struggle to prepare him for the grueling impeachment saga to come. He claimed that his request for Zelensky to investigate Biden -- that appears to signal an abuse of power -- was no different than previous US pressure on Ukraine. Yet warnings that aid would be withheld if Kiev failed to improve its governance and fight corruption — made by several US senators and former Vice President Joe Biden -- are hardly in the same league as making a similar threat in the hope of getting dirt on a political foe. Trump also tried to argue that he'd been courteous with Zelensky -- and the transcript did show the avuncular nature that the President sometimes adopts. At another point, he offered testimony from an ally. ""You folks were saying such lies. Such horrible things about a call that was so innocent and so nice,"" Trump told reporters. ""In fact, (South Carolina Republican Sen.) Lindsey Graham said to me when he read it ... he said 'I can't believe it. I never knew you could be so nice.'"" ""I was nice. I'm nice to a lot of people. People don't understand that. But I was,"" Trump said, for once sounding vulnerable and upset that he's been misunderstood. He went on a Twitter offensive Thursday morning, painting himself as a victim and sharing op-eds and views of conservative allies rushing to his defense. ""THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!"" he tweeted at one point. Repeated pressure But the call transcript showed that Trump repeatedly pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump also asked the Ukrainian leader to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and US Attorney General William Barr on the issue, the call transcript reveals. Initially the impact of the call was to expose the normal partisan fault lines. Democrats declared it a smoking gun and Republicans accused Pelosi of moving without evidence. It was a classic Trump era scenario wherein a person's eyes told them the story their political standpoint required. Yet there was just enough concern and uncertainty on Capitol Hill -- especially after the arrival of a classified version of the whistleblower report -- to suggest that this is one scrape from which Trump won't skip free by sparking a new controversy to hijack the news cycle. ""There's obviously some very troubling things here,"" Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse told reporters on Wednesday night, calling for the kind of sober deliberation that a Congress torn by the nation's political divides rarely exhibits. ""Republicans ought not just circle the wagons and Democrats ought not be using words like 'impeach' before they knew anything about the actual substance,"" he said. Democrats have now gone so far down the road of impeachment that it seems unlikely they will be able to turn back. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that the public evidence so far is ""as damning as you can imagine."" Trump's rock solid support among Republicans means that even if some GOP senators waver, the two-third majority needed to convict a President impeached by the House will be elusive. Yet the President's demeanor -- so different than his usual relentless combative public image -- was enough for pundits, some of whom suggest he has all along wanted to be impeached. Trump will surely come out fighting and he will never give up. But Wednesday's events left a strong impression that he neither wants the agony that is to come nor is fully prepared for it.",CR,,0,||,1,"The heavy-handed and characteristic blend of implied pressure and hinted-at quid pro quos that Trump deployed in the conversation -- that he first perfected as a real estate shark and then took to the White House -- now threatens to work against him.|Many observers, like fired former FBI Director James Comey, have noted that Trump's way of doing business and demands for loyalty have similarities with the loaded language of a mafia don.|But it ended with Democrats increasingly convinced they had the building blocks of a case against the President -- one that will pitch the nation into a long, dark political tunnel.",1,"The behavior that he has always trusted to help him come out on top, with its obfuscation, bullying, fact-bending and conspiracy spinning tangents, suddenly didn't seem to be working.| It was a classic Trump era scenario wherein a person's eyes told them the story their political standpoint required|Democrats declared it a smoking gun and Republicans accused Pelosi of moving without evidence."

It’s a memo to those of us who could never support Donald Trump but think the Bernie-Squad-Warren Democratic Party is sprinting too far left. It’s a memo built around the following question: If the general election campaign turns out to be Trump vs. Warren, what the heck are we supposed to do? The first thing we could do, of course, is pray for a miracle. Maybe the Democrats will nominate one of the five B’s or the K: Biden, Buttigieg, Booker, Bennet, Bullock or Klobuchar. These candidates are pluralists, not purists. They make many voters who disagree with them feel heard and respected. They practice the craft of politics, building majority coalitions to get things done. If the party nominated one of those six, you really could see the Democrats gather progressives and moderates into an enduring majority coalition as the Republicans recede into old, white, rural obsolescence. You could see movement on a range of issues where large majorities are already stacked on one side: guns, climate change, reducing income inequality, expanding health coverage. [The big debates, distilled. This guide will put in context what people are saying about the pressing issues of the week. Sign up for our new newsletter, Debatable.] But right now, Elizabeth Warren has the momentum, and so those of us who feel politically homeless may face a stark choice. For many, supporting Warren is too high a price to pay, even for ousting Trump. “There is no universe where I will ever vote for Donald Trump, and there is no universe where I could ever vote for Elizabeth Warren,” Jennifer Horn, a former chairwoman of the New Hampshire G.O.P., told The Washington Examiner. And you can see why so many people have that reaction. First, there are Warren’s policies. On trade, she’s a protectionist. Her 10-year, $34 trillion health care plan isn’t paid for. Her student debt cancellation plan is a handout to the upper middle class. Her campaign seems to not acknowledge the inevitable trade-off between economic growth and high spending, high taxes and high regulation. Second, she’s one of the few Democrats who could actually lose. As Yascha Mounk notes in The Atlantic, Democrats won in 2018 because they won back a lot of nonpartisan suburban office park workers who found moderates they could vote for. When you remind independents of Democratic support for abolishing private health insurance and decriminalizing unauthorized border crossing — two key Warren policies — they become six percentage points less likely to vote for the Democrats. Trump will tell voters: You may despise me, but she’ll destroy the economy. Editors’ Picks His Family Fled Syria. He Didn’t Cry Until He Heard About His Sisters. Birds Do It. People, Too. Is Migration Simply Natural for All Species? ‘His Body Doesn’t Belong to Me’ Third, a Warren presidency would be deeply polarizing and probably unsuccessful. Warren’s policy ideas would make any progressive-moderate coalition impossible. She’d try to govern with her 40 percent partisan base, just as Trump has, which is no way to pass big legislation. Fourth, there is a wave of insular intolerance coursing through parts of the American left. If given executive power, some progressives may use it to cancel any culture or faith other than their own. And yet …. And yet, if it comes to Trump vs. Warren in a general election, the only plausible choice is to support Warren. Over the past month Donald Trump has given us fresh reminders of the unique and exceptional ways he corrupts American life. You’re either part of removing that corruption or you are not. When your nation’s political system is in danger, staying home and not voting is not a responsible option. Politics is downstream from morality and culture. Warren represents a policy wrong turn, in my view, but policies can be argued about and reversed. Trump represents a much more important and fundamental threat — to the norms, values, standards and soul of this country. Last week, Trump all but greenlighted the ethnic cleansing of Kurds without an ounce of remorse. He normalizes dishonesty and valorizes cruelty. His letter to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reminds us yet again that we have a president whose professional competence is at kindergarten level. Once a nation has lost its heart, mind and soul, it is very hard to get these things back. Furthermore, Trump is an unprecedented threat to democratic institutions. Over the past few years, I’ve thought the progressive fears of incipient American fascism were vastly overblown. But, especially over the past month, Trump has worked overtime to validate those fears and to raise the horrifying specter of what he’ll be like if he is given a second term and is vindicated, unhinged and unwell. In their book “How Democracies Die,” Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt argue that authoritarians undermine democracy in several ways. They reject the democratic rules of the game, the unwritten norms we rely upon to make the political system work. They deny the legitimacy of their political opponents, using extreme language to deny them standing as co-citizens. They tolerate or even encourage violence, threatening to take legal action against critics in rival parties. Trump has been guilty of all three sins, and given a second term he will feel free to stomp where up until now he has merely trod. This election is about whether we can hold together as a functioning nation, across our economic, racial, geographic and ideological divides. In such circumstances, a bad option is better than a suicidal one.",VC,,1,"If the party nominated one of those six, you really could see the Democrats gather progressives and moderates into an enduring majority coalition as the Republicans recede into old, white, rural obsolescence|Trump will tell voters: You may despise me, but she’ll destroy the economy.|Third, a Warren presidency would be deeply polarizing and probably unsuccessful",1,"Democrats gather progressives and moderates into an enduring majority coalition as the Republicans recede into old, white, rural obsolescence. |You could see movement on a range of issues where large majorities are already stacked on one side: guns, climate change, reducing income inequality, expanding health coverage.|Third, a Warren presidency would be deeply polarizing and probably unsuccessful.

A few weeks ago, Kai Cole, the ex-wife of Joss Whedon, the man who created “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and who has been honored for creating strong female characters, wrote a highly personal takedown of him for The Wrap, a Hollywood industry website. In the post, Ms. Cole, a film producer, said that Mr. Whedon “hid multiple affairs” with “his actresses, co-workers, fans and friends” during their 16-year marriage. His explanation for why he had so many female friends, she said, was that “his mother raised him as a feminist.” Moreover, Ms. Cole called out his “hypocrisy” for “preaching feminist ideals” while using their marriage as a “shield” to commit adultery. In essence, she branded Mr. Whedon, the director of the coming “Justice League” superhero film, a fake male feminist. It’s a label that appears to be gaining cultural currency, especially in the Trump era. “Saturday Night Live” aired a sketch last season called “Girl at a Bar” in which a succession of seemingly sensitive male feminists (“I worked for Hillary,” one says) try to pick up a woman at a bar, only to resort to misogynistic language when rebuffed. The three-minute sketch seemed to have hit a chord. Myriad essays that decried wolves in pink pussy hats and “woke misogynists” followed. “Watch S.N.L. Demolish Fake Male Feminists,” read a Vanity Fair headline. “Hating Trump Doesn’t Make a Man a Feminist,” said Bustle, an online culture magazine for women, which argued that “male feminists” have become a “powerful cultural niche,” and cited numerous celebrity examples including Ryan Gosling, Mark Ruffalo and Chris Pratt. Tal Peretz, an assistant professor at Auburn University who specializes in gender studies, sees the criticism of male feminists as an inevitable consequence of social progress. “More men are getting involved in the feminist and women’s rights movements, and I think that the learning curve for them is really steep and really long,” said Dr. Peretz, who is an author of “Some Men: Feminist Allies and the Movement to End Violence Against Women.” “Our bar for men in feminism is getting higher, too, and rightly so.” Examples of these higher standards abound. Critics of men who sport “The Future is Female” T-shirts also maintain that some are using the word “feminist” inappropriately. The preferred term, they argue, is “feminist allies.” The rationale is that white people who fight against racism wouldn’t call themselves “black,” just as straight people who rally for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights wouldn’t call themselves “transgender.” BuzzFeed recently published “17 Types of Male ‘Feminists’ That Need to Be Stopped,” an illustrated list that included a new father who suddenly becomes a feminist after he has a daughter, and a male manager who congratulates himself for hiring a female employee. “It’s something I encounter all the time, but that man Robbie Tripp was the real kick in the pants in inspiring the post,” said Loryn Brantz, who wrote and illustrated the article and is also the author of the book “Feminist Baby.” Mr. Tripp is the San Francisco man who became an internet sensation this summer when he posted a gushing ode to his wife’s “curvy body” on Instagram. People were divided on his seemingly self-congratulatory realization that “the media marginalizes women,” and his appreciation of his wife’s “thick thighs, big booty, cute little side roll.” Some cooed and said “Ah”; others sneered and said “Ew.” “Good Morning America” interviewed the couple in a segment titled “Hero Husband or Fake Feminist?” The culture site Refinery29 dismissed Mr. Tripp’s paean as “the worst type of ‘male feminism.’” Celebrities also weighed in. Melanie Lynskey, who will star in the TV series “Castle Rock,” said on Twitter: “Public announcements of devotion are very sexy to me,” she said. “What isn’t sexy is acting as though you’re one of the few men on earth who could possibly love a woman who looks like that.” Dr. Peretz has coined a term, “the Pedestal Effect,” to describe how men are given special treatment for small acts of gender equality, like changing a diaper or Mr. Tripp’s love letter. “It is basically when guys get a whole lot of bonus points just for being nominal feminists,” he said. Mr. Whedon’s agent did not respond to requests for comment, but a representative released a statement to The Wrap that read: “While this account includes inaccuracies and misrepresentations which can be harmful to their family, Joss is not commenting, out of concern for his children and out of respect for his ex-wife.” Mr. Whedon did, however, give an interview to BuzzFeed in 2015 that seems to have foreshadowed the current hubbub. “When you declare yourself politically, you destroy yourself artistically,” he said in an article about why he deleted his Twitter account (he has since returned). “Because suddenly that’s the litmus test for everything you do — for example, in my case, feminism. If you don’t live up to the litmus test of feminism in this one instance, then you’re a misogynist,” he added. “It circles directly back upon you.” ",VC,,,,,,,

Since then, things have gotten ugly. Lawmakers followed up with a plan — to make it easier to impeach Supreme Court judges who attempt to ""usurp the power"" of the Legislature or governor. Then came a plan to address the court's concerns over school funding: Send a little more money to roughly two-dozen of the state's poorest districts without taking money away from other districts or raising taxes. The plaintiff districts have already responded to the plan, calling it a ""shell game."" It's unclear if the Kansas Supreme Court will be satisfied. What is clear is that the politics of school funding can be bitter. Over the past two weeks, the NPR Ed Team has taken a hard look at how we pay for public schools in the U.S. In Part 1 of our School Money series, we mapped the consequences of a funding system that favors affluent districts.In Part 2, we unpacked the difference a dollar can — and cannot — make in the classroom, finding compelling evidence that money, spent wisely and consistently, can improve the lives and outcomes of disadvantaged students. This week, we grapple with the politics of school money, asking: Is there a better way to pay for our schools? The answer requires that we do two things: explore the challenges to change, and spotlight a few ideas that could lead to a more balanced system. What follows is a wrap-up of our reporting. For nearly every name and place, you'll find a hyperlink to more.The TABOR Trade-Off First, the challenges. In a word: taxes. In 1992, Colorado voters had had enough, no longer trusting state lawmakers to spend their tax dollars wisely. It required that voters, not lawmakers, have the final say on tax increases, and it capped tax revenue. Anything the state raised over that cap — typically in boom years — would be refunded to taxpayers. TABOR's effect on Colorado's schools has been severe. Its cap on property tax revenue limits how much money districts can raise locally. And by capping income tax revenue, the law also limits the state's ability to help schools make up the difference. A one-two punch. ""I don't think people on average knew what it meant, especially long-term,"" says Tracie Rainey with the Colorado School Finance Project, a nonprofit research group. Today, the state's economy is booming. The unemployment rate is just 3 percent. And, thanks to TABOR, taxpayers are on track to get $156 million back from the state. But Rainey says Colorado's schools are struggling more than ever. ""They have outdated technology, larger class sizes. They've lost the opportunity to offer certain programs. They can't retain teachers. They can't attract teachers,"" says Rainey. The list goes on. In 2013, according to Education Week, the state spent roughly $2,500 less per student than the national average. That ranks Colorado, the nation's 14th richest state, below two of the poorest, Mississippi and Alabama. Jon Caldara, president of the Independence Institute, a Colorado-based, free-market think tank, says TABOR's a big reason the state's economy is doing so well. As for its effect on schools, Caldara says, more money isn't the answer. ""I think parents and family members and taxpayers are saying, 'No. Fix the problems. Use the money you have more wisely and educate our children,' "" he says. That's a common refrain, not just in Colorado but across the country.'And Now, This Is Storage"" In 1990, not long before Colorado passed TABOR, voters in Oregon were feeling tax anxiety, too. Many worried that their rising property values would also mean a rise in property taxes. And so, with something called Measure 5, they capped them. Since schools depend heavily on property taxes, the state was supposed to use income tax revenue to help offset the effect of this new cap. There's just one problem: In tough economic times, income is more volatile than property values. And so began a roller coaster for Oregon's schools. Even in Pendleton, an area known for rodeos and ranches, it's been a rough ride. On a recent tour of Pendleton High School, Superintendent Jon Peterson opened the door to a room full of old fish tanks and plastic storage bins. When state funding was good, Pendleton launched a fisheries program. ""We were raising fish and growing plants,"" Peterson says, ""and now this is storage, what you're seeing here. It ended quickly, just kind of after we got it going."" Ten years ago, Pendleton led a lawsuit against the state over its school funding. Voters in Oregon, as in Colorado, ultimately tried to undo some of the damage these tax caps have done to their public schools. But to little effect. In Oregon, the state set up a commission to determine just how much money its schools really needed. Their conclusion: more, a lot more. Voters even approved a requirement that state lawmakers spend what the commission called for. With one caveat. The rule gave legislators an ""out."" They could either fund schools to the level recommended by the commission or write a report explaining why they didn't. Since then, there have been lots of reports. Not once have lawmakers fully funded the commission's recommendation. For more on what's happened in Oregon, click here. Hold Harmless It's obvious but worth saying: Helping low-wealth schools requires buy-in from voters who live beyond those districts' borders. And it requires lawmakers to look past their local interests. Last May, Texas state Rep. Jimmie Don Aycock, a Republican, stood on the bustling floor of the House of Representatives in Austin and asked his fellow lawmakers to do just that. He wanted his colleagues to limit their use of two words: hold harmless. A hold harmless provision creates a kind of force field around a lawmaker's district, temporarily exempting its schools from, say, a budget cut. In 2005, in an attempt to shrink the spending gaps between affluent and low-wealth districts, Texas tried to cap how much property tax revenue a district could raise and spend on its schools. In response, some 900 Texas districts asked to be held harmless. Now, those communities still saw limits to how much they could raise in property tax revenue. But, under the hold harmless provision, the state agreed to use state dollars to make up that difference. The result: Some affluent districts that could raise money locally to pay for their schools were being told not to — and getting more state money in return. Which also means that, while Texas was technically putting more state money into its schools, those dollars weren't targeting its neediest students. In many cases, they were doing the opposite. This hold harmless phenomenon isn't specific to Texas, either. In many states, powerful districts with declining student enrollment have lobbied for, and won, exemptions from state efforts to make school funding more equitable. Ultimately, Rep. Aycock withdrew his bill and is retiring from the Legislature. When it comes to Texas' school funding system, Aycock says, ""I'll go to my grave wishing I could've done more."" To meet one of those districts being held harmless, click here. A Few Big Ideas The stories of Kansas, Colorado, Oregon and Texas are an important reminder of why funding increases most often require a court order: because Americans genuinely don't agree on how — or how much — schools should be funded. But surely there is common ground, somewhere. In an attempt to find it, let's leave behind the conflict and cautionary tales and explore a few big ideas in school funding. Last week, we presented compelling evidence that funding increases can help disadvantaged students — those living in poverty, with disabilities, or who are learning English. Given that many of these students live in property-poor communities, that extra help usually comes from the state. There is no magical spending threshold for success. And attempts at solutions are made incredibly complicated by the fact that different children with different needs require different levels of support. To better understand those needs — and what it will cost to meet them — a state can commission what's called an ""adequacy study."" Most states have already done at least one. Michigan is a late-comer. Its first adequacy study is due out in May. Last year, the state Legislature ponied up $500,000 to get it started. They hired Augenblick, Palaich and Associates, or APA — a consulting firm that's done dozens of school funding studies for states across the country. Justin Silverstein is heading up the Michigan study from his office in Colorado. He and his team aren't going to Michigan to visit classrooms or interview teachers. Instead, they're wading through tons of data to find the answer. They're using the ""successful schools"" model, which means they're only going to look at data from the most successful districts in the state — districts that are performing at or above the state average on tests. ""How are they spending funds? Where are they getting revenues? So we're trying to get a real good picture of the fiscal realities for those districts,"" explains Silverstein. That includes how much money successful districts spend on at-risk students and whether it's more expensive to teach in certain parts of the state. Almost every study Silverstein's firm has done has found that states need to spend more money to give all students a shot at meeting state academic standards. But that hasn't always led to increased spending. ""Having good information doesn't mean you can get change done right away,"" Silverstein says. Many times, states get back their adequacy studies and do nothing. Property Tax, Revisited Studying adequacy is one thing. Wyoming is trying to guarantee it. Nine years ago, Mark Shrum moved his family to the city of Gillette, in the northeast part of the state, for two reasons: a coal-mine job and good schools. This March, Shrum was laid off from the Powder River Basin's Buckskin coal mine, but he's not leaving. But it's a start. But how, exactly, does a state know how much money is enough money? ""Members, it's just a small, technical cleanup of a little bit of school finance stuff, and I move to passage,"" Aycock said. They amended the state's constitution with something called the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, or TABOR.""We're in a tremendous setting for our kids, academically,"" says Shrum. ""It's one of the primary reasons we're doing everything we can to stay here."" The Campbell County School District operates a children's museum and a mental health clinic. Kids can take swim lessons in the district's aquatic center, and the state is funding construction of a brand new high school. ""You see a lot of money spent on the students: the technology, the nice buildings,"" says Shrum. ""And high salaries keep good teachers here, even though we don't have shopping, restaurants and the things cities have."" When it comes to school funding, Wyoming is an exception among states in more ways than one. It's got relatively few students and spends a lot on them.According to Education Week, after adjusting for regional cost differences, Wyoming spends an average of $17,513 per pupil, ranking among the top-five spenders in the nation. The national average is $11,841 per child. Where did all of this money come from? Two answers. First, an energy boom helped fuel a boom in school funding. The production of oil, gas and Gillette coal accounts for 70 percent of state revenue. Then there's the legal answer. In response to several lawsuits demanding better school funding, the Wyoming Supreme Court told lawmakers to ""treat the wealth of the state as a whole."" That led to a rare, Robin Hood-style funding model where some property tax revenues generated in mineral-rich districts like Campbell County are redistributed by the state to other, poorer districts. The court-ordered changes ""essentially doubled the amount of state resources we were putting into education and in some ways more than doubled it,"" says Mary Kay Hill, the policy director for the state's current governor, Matt Mead. To be clear, affluent districts can still raise and spend money locally, and big spending gaps remain. But state policymakers are quick to point out that, in every Wyoming district, funding now exceeds the national average. ""We put an awful lot of effort into ensuring that every kid in the state has access to the same education,"" says Sen. Chris Rothfuss, a Laramie Democrat. There's another important asterisk to the Wyoming story: Despite its outsize funding, test scores haven't risen with this two-decade investment. The state remains in the middle of the pack in most measures of academic achievement. But don't tell that to Mark Shrum. When he and his family moved to Gillette from Sacramento in 2007, their son Jarrett was at the bottom of his class. Now 17, Jarrett is a straight-A junior at Campbell County High School. Seventh-grader Cody is in his school's gifted and talented program and travels the state for science competitions. For more on Wyoming's approach to school funding, click here. Local Control Not all school funding problems are about the funding itself. Often, when cash-strapped schools do get extra money from the state or federal government, it comes with strict rules about how they can spend it. While those rules are generally well-intentioned, they can be inflexible, prohibiting a principal from using the money where it's needed most. California is trying to change that. After lunch at Oak Ridge Elementary in Sacramento, Calif., a fight breaks out. Principal Daniel Rolleri hurries to the scene, his walkie-talkie squawking. A sixth-grade girl has been hit in the face. ""She's going to relax in my office for a little bit,"" says Rolleri, as he walks her inside. ""She's a little emotional, a little upset.""Every teacher at this school has a way of helping kids calm down. Rolleri's technique is aromatherapy. He sits the girl down in his office, lets her choose from three different aromas, turns on a small water fountain, and gives her some time alone. Rolleri says students here lash out not because they're bad kids, but because many live in poverty. Life at home can be stressful and frustrating. He's determined to use state funding to help these kids feel good about themselves. Just a few years ago, low-spending California made it easier for him to do that. ""We are bringing government closer to the people, to the classroom where real decisions are made, and directing the money where the need and the challenge is greatest,"" said Gov. Jerry Brown in 2013, the year California enacted what's known as the Local Control Funding Formula. The formula embodies more than one big idea. It's meant to send more money to districts, like Rolleri's, that serve disadvantaged students. It's also meant to give Rolleri — and his community — a greater say in how that money is spent. The formula requires that school leaders work hand in hand with teachers, parents and community leaders to lay out goals they hope the funding can help them accomplish. Rolleri won't be judged simply on his students' test scores but also on things like parent involvement, student engagement and school climate. In 2015-2016, Oak Ridge got $187,000 in extra state funding for its high-needs students, and Rolleri struggled with how best to spend it. ""Just because we do have additional state funding, [that] doesn't make the job easy,"" Rolleri says. ""I would even say it's harder because inherently there is the obligation that we can't ruin this, we can't mess this up."" To find out how Rolleri chose to spend the money, click here. The Federal Role So far in this series, we've heard a lot about state and local spending in schools — but little about the federal government's role in all of this. The fact is, on average, federal money accounts for only around 10 percent of school spending. But, in high-need schools, that money can be a lifeline. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson helped create the federal education program known as Title I. It was part of his War on Poverty, and it sends federal dollars to schools that educate lots of low-income students.It was intended to help places like Holmes County, Miss., where schools serve some of the poorest students in the nation. The median income there is just north of $22,000 a year. District resources — or a lack of them — reflect that poverty, with Holmes spending $8,368 per student (the number has been adjusted by Education Week to reflect regional cost differences). That's roughly $3,500 below the national average. For every child.The extra $1,500 per student in Title I money that Holmes receives — it matters. ""We need those resources,"" says Holmes County Superintendent Angel Meeks. On last year's statewide reading assessment, nearly two-thirds of the district's incoming freshmen scored well below grade level. If she could, Meeks says, she'd use her federal dollars to pay for a literacy coach and a reading interventionist. It's just not enough money. Mississippi could be getting more, says Nora Gordon, an associate professor of public policy at Georgetown University. She has spent her career studying Title I and its effects on schools and has just released a few big ideas to improve it. ""About a third of the kids in Mississippi are eligible [for Title I], more than any other state,"" Gordon says. ""Yet, among all states, Mississippi is near the bottom in how much help it receives per child."" The average Title I allotment for a student in Mississippi? $1,100. Alaska, North Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming all have far fewer poor students but receive more than twice as much federal funding for each of them. Why? Several reasons, but the real difference-maker is in the Title I math itself. ""It rewards places that spend more,"" Gordon says. And Mississippi, in addition to being one of the poorest states in the nation, also has one of the lowest per-pupil spending rates. In this way, Title I, an anti-poverty program, privileges more affluent, high-spending states. But, Gordon argues, it doesn't have to. For more on Gordon's proposed fixes to Title I, click here. Lessons Learned Over the past three weeks, the NPR Ed Team and our 20 member station collaborators have taken readers (and listeners) from the rain-soaked ceiling of a rural Alabama school to Wyoming coal country, where the best place to find water is in the district's beloved aquatic center. We've explored the imbalance that exists in many state funding systems between affluent districts and property-poor districts, and given voice to the students, parents and educators who feel they aren't getting the resources they need. To those who respond, ""But money doesn't matter,"" we've offered compelling evidence that it does, especially for disadvantaged children. The achievement gap between this nation's wealthiest and poorest students is growing dramatically, not shrinking. Something's not working. Our reporting suggests that the solution, however, is not for lawmakers and taxpayers to simply open their pocketbooks. The solution is dialogue — for all Americans to look more closely at the school across town or down-state and to consider the stories of the students inside. Because not every child is the same, but every one deserves the same access to a good education. And so let's leave the last word to Texas state Rep. Jimmie Don Aycock, whom we met earlier. He said this last May on the floor of the Texas Statehouse: ""We think in terms of black kids and brown kids and white kids. We think of poor kids and rich kids, kids from small districts and kids from larger districts. And we each come here representing our subset of kids, and that's how the process works."" Aycock asked his fellow Texas lawmakers: ""What will it take to fix school finance? It'll take a common view of [the state's] 5.2 million children.""And of the nation's 50 million schoolchildren, too.",VC,,0,,1,"The plaintiff districts have already responded to the plan, calling it a ""shell game.""

Experts agree that Trump has sustained major damage, and that the Republicans will now be hard pressed to defend him. Surely now he’s finished. To which I say, are you kiddin’ me? The Right Wing propaganda machine, what Jon Stewart called “Bullshit Mountain” is going to go into overdrive now. Does anyone think that the people who slavishly watch Fox’s hideous nighttime lineup will hear ANY objective news about this? Any at all? Do you think that the 1500 right-wing hate radio programs in America will do ANYTHING except rip into the “Demonrats” as we are so affectionately called? Does ANYONE think that The Federalist and RedState and Breitbart and every other right-wing site will do ANYTHING except counterattack? Does ANYONE think that Jordan, Meadows, Gaetz, Nunes, and all the other disgusting Trump Zombies in Congress will do ANYTHING except defend Trump to the utmost, and in the most dishonest, depraved manner possible? Does ANYONE think that the most dangerous man in America, “Attorney General” William Barr, will do ANYTHING except turn the full power of the “Justice” Department on Trump’s enemies? Get serious. You know all the bad news that Trump has been bombarded with lately? You know how Nate Silver’s site generally shows that 42% of likely voters support Trump? Surely his numbers have gone down, right? This morning Trump’s approval among likely voters was 42%. This news about Taylor? I’m sorry, but Taylor is about to be smeared, lied about, and denigrated in the ugliest terms. So what if he is a veteran with a distinguished record? So what if he has decades of service to his country? None of that will mean jack shit to Sean Hannity. Hannity called Robert Mueller a criminal. You think Taylor will get any less hatred than that? My point is this. Yes, we should impeach Trump. Put him on trial in the Senate. But I’m telling you, getting 67 votes to convict is going to be a monumental task. Even if we keep all 47 of our caucus in line (Hiya, Joe Manchin!), who are the 20 Republicans who will vote to convict? Romney, almost certainly. Who else? Gutless coward Rubio? Groveling Trump worshiper Graham? Susan “Concerned” Collins? Gimme names. It’s said that McConnell, “The Gravedigger of Democracy”, will encourage conviction if he thinks keeping Trump in will cost the Republicans the Senate. I don’t buy it. I’ll believe it when I see it. And after Trump is acquitted, and he brags that he has been exonerated, the same 42-43% will still be on his side. And if there is no recession, Trump will be even money to be reelected. If you know me, if you’ve read my work, you know how bitterly I hate the Orange Shitgibbon. The son of a bitch has been RAPING and LOOTING the country of my birth. If I had the power to simply push a button and make him disappear, I would. But I don’t. Don’t you see? Don’t you see? The Right Wingers have been playing the long game. They have spent decades building a propaganda infrastructure of enormous power and influence. This infrastructure’s audience is mostly immune to any criticism of Trump. It does. Not. Matter. what Trump does. It does. Not. Matter. how terrible, corrupt, or harmful his actions are. Bullshit Mountain’s victims simply ignore or reject anything that disturbs their idealized picture of Trump. And, btw, you need to keep this in mind: these people hate us. We are, literally, the worst thing in the world. For over 60 years people like us have been demonized. It has had an effect. A Trump supporter in Tennessee, dying of a treatable condition, said he would rather die than use Obamacare. Trump supporters in Alabama, despite some notable defections, voted overwhelmingly for a Senate candidate credibly accused of pedophilia. Yes, even a pedophile is better than one of us. A Trump supporter recently announced he would rather live under Vladimir Putin (!) than a Democrat. Two Trump supporters were photographed wearing shirts that said, “I’d Rather Be a Russian Than a Democrat”. Hillary Clinton was routinely called “C*nt” by these people in 2016. About a year ago, a poll showed that 17% of Republicans had a positive view of Kim Jong Un, the most barbaric, murderous dictator on the planet. Nancy Pelosi’s positive rating was 15% They. Hate. Us. We will never change them. They will vote to strip themselves of healthcare. They will vote to lose their family farm to the trade war. They will vote to see their public schools ruined. They will vote against their own children’s future. They don’t care. Angering and hurting us is their highest goal. So we must EXPAND the electorate. I’ve flogged this issue again and again and again. But you see, you’ve gotta stop thinking that things like the Taylor testimony will do any harm to Trump politically. I hope I’m wrong. But every. Damned. Day. 42-43%. It never changes. It will not matter if we win the popular vote again in 2020. Hell, we’ve done that 6 out of the past 7 elections. Only ONE number counts. 270. 270, baby. That’s the ballgame. We have to hold every Clinton state and flip several Trump states. No easy task. I have set out a program to help us do just that. This is it (so far): A. We need to PERSONALLY contact, in a face-to-face way, at LEAST 100,000,000 U.S. voters. The reasons we must do that are laid out HERE. B. We must EXPAND the electorate. We must turn out at LEAST 85,000,000 Democratic voters. The groups we most need to target are examined right HERE. C. Registering new voters is KEY. Voter registration information is HERE. D. Each Democratic activist should set a goal of registering at least 10 new Democratic voters. My thoughts on how to do this are HERE. E. We need clear, effective talking points and a clear plan of action. My suggestions for all of these things are HERE. F. You can already donate money to whoever ends up as Trump’s Democratic opponent. That can be done HERE. G. Florida is a MUST-HAVE state, and Puerto Rican voters are crucial. Here’s what needs doing right HERE. H. The women of America are KEY to our victory. Here’s why, HERE. I. Why I am a GOTV fanatic, with some eye-opening stats, right HERE. J. Pennsylvania is KEY. Let’s go for it! Here’s how, right HERE. K. Ohio is KEY. Let’s go for it. Here’s how, right HERE. L. Michigan is KEY. Let’s go for it. Here’s how, right HERE. And in the next few weeks I will have “Let’s Win” diaries for Wisconsin, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Texas, and Arizona as well. It will not be easy. For my part, I will sacrifice anything I need to. But stop holding on to the hope that bad news will sink Trump. All he has to do is stonewall 100% and use Billy Boy Barr to go after his critics and accusers. He can survive this Taylor episode. I hope I’m wrong. But I don’t think I am. Get out the vote. Get out the vote. GET OUT THE G-D DAMNED VOTE.

The Washington Post reported on a group of ""elite"" local firefighters, known as the ""guerreiros de fogo"" or ""fire warriors,"" who are still fighting fires in Mato Gross, Brazil. Led by former US Army paratrooper John Carter, these local, well-trained firefighters cover hundreds of miles each day putting out or containing fires. And they're making a difference. They're also not the only ones fighting fires in the Amazon. In Brazil, after international condemnation about the state of the rainforest, President Jair Bolsonaro sent in 44,000 troops to douse fires at the end of August. Bolivia also 5,000 soldiers to fight the forest fires in its chunk of the Amazon. Here's what it's like for the ""fire warriors"" on the frontlines. In August, Brazil's rainforest was burning the most since 2010. At one point, 31,000 fires were burning ... ... which created a 1.2 million-square-mile layer of smoke. After facing intense scrutiny from the international community, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro agreed to send in 44,000 troops to fight the fires at the end of August. By September, the number of fires burning had fallen to 20,000 — a six year low. It's unusual, because September is usually when fires increase. For comparison, 24,500 fires burned in September 2018. And it's likely that the decrease is a mix of Brazil's military fighting the fires and more rain, Maria Silva Dias, a professor and forest fire expert at the University of Sao Paulo, told Reuters. Fires, many of which were started on purpose to clear land for farming, have burned indiscriminately — in parks, ranches, government land, and indigenous land. At the end of August, Bolsonaro also issued a 60-day ban on starting fires. Here, a firefighter from the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) attempts to control the direction of the fire on indigenous land in September. Another member of IBAMA fire brigades extinguishes the smoldering remains of a fire here. Before the fires broke out this year, Bolsonaro spoke about shutting down the organization, because he wanted forested regions to be developed. The government still sent them in, though, and barred members from speaking to the media. Some of the firefighters wield eight-foot poles with mats attached to the end, and slap them down on the fires. Or they shoot water from hoses attached to water tanks, like a ""child's Super Soaker,"" ABC News reported. They use all of the tools they have on hand. Water bags are refilled from nearby streams ... dirt is shoveled on to fires to suffocate them ... and from the sky, fighter jets dump water and fire retardant onto fires. The Brazilian government also hired a Boeing 747-400, which is capable of dropping 19,000 gallons per trip, to assist. But for the most part, firefighters' tools are rudimentary. And the Amazon is so large that firefighters can't stop many of the fires. In Bolivia, at least 4.2 million acres of forest have burned. The government sent in 5,000 troops to battle the fires, and said it has spent $20 million on the fight. The fires became so bad Bolivian President Evo Morales put his re-election campaign on hold to fight the fires. Despite his firsthand efforts to help, environmentalists have criticized him for passing laws that encourage slash and burning to make room for farmland. Some volunteer firefighters in Bolivia worked by night to keep cool, and to be able to see the fires more clearly. Here, it's police and military working as a group to stop a fire, but farmers, accountants, and construction workers have also made up the crews fighting Bolivia's fires. Often, they're doing it with donated gear, including fire hoses that are full of holes. It's dangerous work. A volunteer named Andres Manaca was nearly trapped by fires twice over an eight-day period he spent fighting them. At one point he was in a group of volunteers who had to flee as the fire came for them. “It was violent, like lightning,” he told The Guardian. And it's not always a rewarding job, in the traditional sense. One firefighter chief told ABC News he was aware fighting the flames was futile, but if they could save a few things, it was worth it. Not everyone thinks firefighters have made a difference. Retired colonel Angelo Robelo, who has fought poachers and monitored fires in the Amazon for 30 years, told ABC News only mother nature could make a difference. But it appears they have made an impact. Bolivia's armed forces commander said there was no plan to withdraw the troops. So for now, the firefighters will continue on. And soldiers, like this one, will continue to monitor the progress of one of the worst years for Amazon Rainforest fires in recent history. ",CR,,0,,0,,0,

The embattled company announced its plans to cut the workers in an Oct. 20 letter to the Employment Development Department of California (EDD). The company did so because state law dictates that employers inform the EDD and affected employees 60 days before conducting a ""plant closing or mass layoff."" In the letter obtained by BuzzFeed News, LuLaRoe said it will ""permanently lay-off [its] warehouse workforce"" in Corona five days before Christmas. Every employee — from the warehouse's maintenance engineer to forklift drivers — will be affected. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, LuLaRoe confirmed the warehouse will be permanently closed and the company's shipping operations will be moved to its distribution center in South Carolina. ""Understanding the significant impact this decision would have in the lives of so many families and the local community—this decision was not made lightly; and was a sole effort to meet the immediate and long term business and operational demands needed to continue pioneering the social retail industry,"" a spokesperson for LuLaRoe said. The spokesperson added they are connecting the employees with staffing agencies, ""knowing they will continue to succeed and shine on the road ahead."" The Press-Enterprise first reported that the company had informed the EDD of the layoffs. The last few years have been rough for LuLaRoe. The company made a name for itself by signing up thousands of women to sell its popular, comfy leggings and reportedly selling $2.3 billion worth of products in 2017 alone. Pretty soon, however, angry former consultants began to speak out. They filed class-action lawsuits in 2017, claiming they had been hoodwinked into nothing more than a ""pyramid scheme."" Women told BuzzFeed News that same year they had lost thousands of dollars trying to start their LuLaRoe businesses, leaving many of them in debt. Dozens of former consultants ended up filing for bankruptcy. In 2018, the company's main clothing supplier, Providence Industries, sued LuLaRoe for $49 million, claiming it hadn't been paid. And the legal cases haven't stopped: Another class-action lawsuit filed in Washington state earlier this year accused the company of being a fraud.",VC,,0,,0,,0,

This amendment is designed to replace the Democratic majority on the high court with a Republican one, even if the GOP wins fewer votes statewide—as was the case with the state’s congressional delegation under the old map.This development is the latest Republican move to undermine genuine electoral reform in Pennsylvania. Recently, GOP lawmakers grabbed hold of a widely supported proposal to create an independent redistricting commission and turned it on its head with an amendment that would give the legislature full power to determine who would sit on the panel. This erosion of independence divided reform advocates despite reluctant support from some legislative Democrats, because a deadlock on the panel would return mapmaking power to the legislature. But now that Republicans have added judicial redistricting to the commission's purview, there’s no longer a divide: Reform groups have universally denounced it and all but two Democrats in the state Senate voted against it. (The House has yet to take it up.) Currently, judges on both the state Supreme Court and its two intermediate appellate courts are elected statewide; Republicans want to replace that system by dividing the state up into districts, which would give them the chance to draw lines that favor themselves. To justify this departure from current practice, Republicans are offering an almost comical pretext: The 31 judges who currently sit on these three courts hail from only 15 of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, so district-based elections would allow for greater representation of … counties. This, of course, is just a thinly veiled way to lie with statistics, because those 15 counties hold 58 percent of the state’s population. It’s as nonsensical as Donald Trump pointing to county-level election results to hide the fact that a majority of Americans live in counties he lost. More importantly, it should hardly matter how many counties are home to appellate judge, since judges do not “represent” voters (or counties!) the way that legislators do—their job is instead to interpret and uphold the law. And it should go without saying, but judges have no role in the sort of political deal-making that sees legislators seek to promote the economic or cultural interests of their particular districts. As absurd as these claims might seem, though, they mask a serious issue: the ongoing conservative assault on judicial independence, which has become part of a widespread trend among Republicans in state legislatures across the country over the last decade. When lawmakers like those in Pennsylvania refuse to stop gerrymandering, the courts have become the last resort for those fighting for fair elections. Attempts to gerrymander the judicial branch are a direct attempt to undermine efforts at reform, meaning they’re poised to become the next frontier in the GOP's crusade to subvert electoral democracy. Pennsylvania Republicans will probably be able to refer their amendment to the voters in time for the next round of redistricting, since it only takes a simple majority vote this year and then again after the 2018 elections to put it on the ballot. And because they've already gerrymandered their own districts, they're unlikely to lose their majorities this fall, so reformers will likely have to wage a fierce battle at the ballot box if the GOP proceeds with this power grab. We at Daily Kos Elections have long been opposed to the almost uniquely American institution of judicial elections because politicizing justice undermines its impartial administration. But since these elections aren’t going to be abolished anytime soon, they must at least be conducted in a manner that treats voters equally, regardless of their race or party. VOTER SUPPRESSION ● Indiana: A federal court has temporarily blocked Indiana Republicans from proceeding with a planned mass purge of voter registrations before an upcoming trial over the their attempt to implement the deliberately defective Crosscheck system developed by the notorious Kris Kobach. Crosscheck only uses voters' names and birthdates, which has been shown to produce numerous false positives for every potential case of improper registration. In granting the injunction, the court held that using Crosscheck to remove voters without notifying them would violate the National Voter Registration Act (aka the “Motor Voter” law). ● Missouri: Priorities USA, a top Democratic super PAC, has filed a lawsuit in state court arguing that Missouri's GOP-backed voter ID law violates the state constitution, even though Republicans won voter approval in 2016 to add a photo ID requirement to the constitution. The new suit argues that this amendment did not in fact negate another provision of the state constitution, one that guarantees the right to vote. As a result, plaintiffs say that the statute Republicans passed in 2016 to implement the amendment is itself unconstitutional. This latest challenge comes after a separate suit backed by the ACLU, NAACP, and the League of Women Voters was dismissed earlier this year. However, that case relied on a different legal theory, so it’s possible the outcome could be different this time. ● North Carolina: When North Carolina's Republican-run legislature is in session, we can expect a new voter suppression scheme just about every week, and this one is no different. With almost no warning or debate, GOP legislators introduced a bill on Thursday, which they passed on Friday, that would eliminate early voting on the final Saturday before Election Day. Since Republicans previously eliminated the final Sunday of early voting, this move would spell the end of all early voting during the weekend immediately prior to every election. A sizable majority of North Carolina voters typically cast ballots before Election Day, and early voting is disproportionately popular among black voters. Indeed, 200,000 people reportedly voted on the final Saturday before the 2016 elections. In addition, the early voting period is the only time when North Carolina law lets voters register and cast a ballot on the same day, which lowers the barriers to participation and has helped lead to higher turnout. Canceling the final weekend of early voting makes it even harder for to cast a ballot close to Election Day if they can't take off from work In a devious move, this bill also imposes financially burdensome restrictions on counties regarding when and where they have to offer early voting during the 17-day early voting period that would now end on the Friday before Election Day. The bill requires all counties to keep early voting sites that operate from Monday through Friday open from 7 AM to 7 PM, and it would require all early voting locations within the county to be open if any of them are, including on weekends. Currently, counties have flexibility on hours of operation and which sites to open, allowing them to determine how they can best allocate their resources to meet the needs of voters. This bill's inflexible requirement could consequently put a strain on county budgets, which could in turn prompt them to reduce the number of early voting locations and might also deter them from offering early voting even on weekends prior to the final weekend of early voting. In other words, by seemingly mandating more early voting hours, Republicans may have found a way to ensure less opportunity for early voting. Republicans hold veto-proof majorities in both chambers thanks to their legislative gerrymanders, and they can override a likely veto from Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper if they so desire. Consequently, Democrats and voting rights advocates will likely have to resort to yet another lawsuit to stop these changes and preserve existing access to the ballot. ● Ohio: On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court delivered a major blow to voting rights when it ruled five-to-four along ideological lines that Ohio's purges of infrequent voters did not violate the 1993 National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), commonly called the Motor Voter law. This ruling gives Republican-run states the green light to aggressively purge their voter registration rolls without informing nonetheless eligible voters that they have been removed, leaving them with no recourse if they show up to vote on Election Day. At issue in this case was the way in which Ohio Republicans, under the leadership of Secretary of State Jon Husted, have pruned voters who fail to vote in a given two-year period. If these voters don't respond to a single follow-up postcard sent to their homes and then subsequently don't vote in over the next four years, they’re taken off the rolls without further notice. The NVRA, however, prohibits states from purging eligible voters ""solely"" for exercising their right not to vote, and a federal appeals court found that Ohio’s purges violated federal law and ordered that roughly 7,500 voters be restored to the rolls ahead of the 2016 elections. However, the Supreme Court accepted the GOP's dubious argument that they weren't purging voters solely for failing to vote but for not responding to the mailer. Of course, as anyone who has ever discarded junk mail or has had something sent to the wrong address—in other words, practically everyone—would know, it's easy for these mailings to not get properly delivered or noticed by the voter, particularly if it's only sent a single time. Large numbers of voters could therefore wind up going to vote for the first time in several years only to find that they have been removed from the roll books. This of course appears to be exactly what the GOP wants, since these infrequent voters are disproportionately black and lean Democratic. Despite this adverse ruling, voting rights advocates are not without tools they can use to fight back against purges like these. While the Supreme Court ruled that these voter purges are allowed under the NVRA, it did not address whether they might violate the Voting Rights Act by discriminating against black or Latino voters. Indeed, in a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that if these purges have a discriminatory impact, they could run afoul of the Voting Rights Act. In one study she cited, majority-black neighborhoods in downtown Cincinnati saw 10 percent of voters removed due to inactivity since 2012, while a white suburban neighborhood had only four percent purged. Nevertheless, prolonged litigation can't be the only answer to stop these undemocratic purges of eligible voters, and there needs to be a permanent solution. If Democrats retake Congress and the presidency, they could amend the NVRA or even pass a new Voting Rights Act to override the Supreme Court's interpretation of the existing statute. They could also enact same-day voter registration nationwide, which would allow voters to register and cast ballots at the same time, eliminating the surprise of showing up at a polling location only to find you don’t have a valid registration. With Republicans in firm control of the federal government, congressional action is unlikely anytime soon. But in the meantime, Democrats can push to expand access to voter registration at the state level, and even use ballot initiatives to overcome recalcitrant legislatures. REDISTRICTING ● Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana: On Wednesday, a group affiliated with former Attorney General Eric Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee filed three federal lawsuits claiming that Republican congressional gerrymanders in Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana violate the Voting Rights Act (VRA) by diluting the power of black voters. If plaintiffs succeed, each state could be required to redraw its congressional map for the 2020 elections to create an additional district where black voters could elect their preferred candidates. However, the burden of proof on the plaintiffs is high. That's because in 2009, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court ruled that VRA lawsuits like these have to demonstrate that a hypothetical new district could be drawn with a majority-black population, even if a district without a black majority could nevertheless elect black voters’ candidates of choice. But if the plaintiffs successfully prove another majority-black district could be drawn, the VRA doesn't require the remedial district to have a black majority, as long as there’s a sufficient population of white voters who will back black voters’ candidates of choice—in practice, black Democrats. (We’ll delve into why this distinction matters below.) We can demonstrate how this might work with two hypothetical maps of Louisiana. Under the state’s current map, black voters are able to elect their preferred candidates in only a single congressional district, the 2nd.The plaintiffs will have to show that two majority-black districts could be drawn and that the black populations within them are reasonably compact. That map on the left does just that: The adult population in both the 2nd and 5th districts is just over 50 percent black in each case. If the court then agrees that this map satisfies the VRA and therefore requires the creation of a second seat where black voters can elected their preferred candidates, a remedial plan could look like the map on the right. That map created two districts where African Americans aren't a majority in either the 2nd or 6th, but black voters in each district would still be able to elect their preferred candidates thanks to the support of a minority of white voters. So why not adopt the first map? The second is preferable because it splits fewer communities of interest—for instance, it puts the urban core of the New Orleans area in a single district—and its districts are also more compact. Similarly, plaintiffs are arguing that Alabama should have drawn another black district in addition to the existing 7th District by connecting Mobile with the rural Black Belt and Montgomery, which you can see an estimation of in this hypothetical map where the 2nd and 7th districts are majority black. In Georgia, meanwhile, they’re claiming the state’s 12th District could have been made majority-black by connecting Savannah with the Black Belt cities of Augusta and Macon, which we we’ve approximated with this map that keeps the existing 2nd District plurality-black, as it currently is. As we mentioned above, it can be difficult to prevail in cases like these. However, if Democrats succeed, the Deep South could wind up with three more districts where black voters can elect their preferred candidates, ensuring a much more equitable distribution of congressional seats. FELONY DISENFRANCHISEMENT ● Louisiana: After their defeat in lower courts, the plaintiffs who are suing to overturn Louisiana's disenfranchisement of those on parole or probation for felony convictions will appeal to the state Supreme Court, where conservatives hold a majority. While Louisiana's GOP-run legislature surprisingly passed a bipartisan law in recent weeks to restore voting rights for those who have been out of prison for at least five years, that welcome change will still only affect three percent of those who are disenfranchised post-incarceration, so there's still a long way to go to correct this injustice. BALLOT MEASURES ● Maine: On Tuesday, voters in Maine chose nominees for federal and statewide office using the state’s new system for instant-runoff voting (IRV), both firsts in U.S. history. Voters simultaneously approved a referendum to keep IRV in place by a 54-46 margin, with 90 percent of precincts reporting at press time. That victory showed increased support for IRV (also called ranked-choice voting), which first passed at the ballot by a smaller 52-48 spread in 2016. Consequently, IRV will be used for Maine's primaries and for general elections at the federal level for the foreseeable future. However, it may not be put to use for state-level general elections, as we'll explain below. First, though, we’ll delve into the mechanics, since IRV is seldom-used in the United States (though it’s more popular in other countries). Maine’s new system lets voters rank their candidates in order of preference, choosing as many or as few candidates as they please. If no one wins a majority in the first round, the last-place candidate is eliminated and has their votes redistributed to their voters' subsequent preferences. This process repeats until one candidate obtains a majority. However, the “instant” part of the runoff isn’t necessarily so instant: Because of the particulars of how the state and municipalities administer elections in Maine, the counting in races where no candidate took a first-round majority will continue next week. So why did Mainers have to vote on whether to keep IRV in place less than two years after deciding to implement it in the first place? In short, hostility from the legislature. Because Maine doesn’t permit voters to propose their own constitutional amendments, the 2016 ballot measure only had the force of an ordinary statute, which meant that lawmakers could repeal it, as long as they were willing to subvert the will of the public. And indeed they were: Last year, nearly every Republican legislator, along with a handful of Democrats, voted for a law that would have effectively repealed IRV. To block this repeal, reformers put this latest measure on Tuesday’s ballot, a so-called “people’s veto” that has the effect of un-doing the legislature’s attempt to eliminate IRV. There’s another complication as well. Back in 2017, the state Supreme Court issued an advisory opinion saying that IRV ran afoul of language in the state constitution saying that only a plurality is necessary for a candidate to win a state-level election, such as a race for governor. (This wording doesn’t apply to primaries or to federal races of any kind.) However, the opinion was non-binding, so IRV is still technically set to be used in this fall's state races, and Republicans are all but certain to wage a new lawsuit asking the state Supreme Court to issue a binding opinion blocking IRV from the November ballot. It’s probable that IRV’s status could only be assured with an amendment to the state constitution, but because such amendments can only be put forth by the legislature, and because Republicans remain opposed to the idea, we’re unlikely to see that happen any time soon. That could change, though. Republicans have been hostile to IRV in general elections because of the perception that it would have cost them the governor's race in 2010, when a left-leaning independent split the vote with a Democrat and allowed Republican Paul LePage to win with just 38 percent of the vote. However, there’s reason to think that the continued use of this system will see Republicans warm to the idea over time. That’s because IRV isn't a system that favors Democrats but rather democracy itself, by ensuring a candidate can't win simply due to divided opposition. In fact, in the gubernatorial election immediate prior to LePage’s first win, Democratic Gov. John Baldacci won re-election ... with just 38 percent of the vote, again thanks to a divided field. If Republicans find themselves on the wrong side of another race like that one day, they may yet come around to the idea of enshrining IRV in Maine's constitution. ELECTIONS ● Wisconsin: Gov. Scott Walker and his Republican allies in the legislature went all-out in their efforts to leave two state legislative seats vacant for nearly a year because they were worried they’d lose them, but after multiple courts rebuked the GOP and forced Walker to call those special elections in March, Democrats indeed flipped one of those two districts on Tuesday. That victory cuts the GOP's majority to just 18-15 in the state Senate, boosting Democratic chances of breaking Republican control over state government before the next round of redistricting, which would allow them to block future gerrymanders.

This obstructionist strategy worked once before, as the White House effectively stonewalled the House Judiciary Committee's investigation of Robert Mueller's findings on Russian election interference by instructing executive branch employees not to comply with subpoenas. But this time, something is different. Now, some executive branch employees who had received orders from the White House to clam up chose to comply with the House's request for testimony, as required by law. By doing so, those dutiful public officials met their oath of office to uphold the Constitution and, in the process, called the White House's high-stakes bluff. Former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch defied the White House's instruction to remain silent and instead testified to the House about the efforts of Trump's counsel, Rudy Giuliani, to have her removed from her post; one House member said she gave a ""gripping and emotional account of presidential abuse of power."" Fiona Hill, Trump's former top Russia adviser, testified White House officials were alarmed by Trump's potentially illegal conduct toward Ukraine even before the July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky. And Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified Trump ordered diplomatic professionals to deal with Ukraine through Giuliani, which left Sondland ""disappointed"" -- particularly when he discovered (later, he claimed) that Giuliani's agenda included prompting Ukraine to investigate Trump's political rivals. Trump could have tried to enforce his direction to executive branch employees not to cooperate by going to court and seeking restraining orders preventing them from testifying. But -- perhaps recognizing that his legal grounding was shaky at best -- he didn't. Trump blinked. He got caught bluffing and, when Yovanovitch and others called him, he folded. Now that the parade of witnesses has started, Congress and the public will learn more about Trump's efforts to push Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. Bill Taylor -- the top US diplomat in Ukraine, who famously texted Sondland that it would be ""crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign"" -- provided devastating testimony Tuesday. In his opening statement, Taylor established clear as day that there absolutely was a ""quid pro quo"" of American foreign aid in exchange for Ukrainian investigations of Trump's political rivals. Taylor's testimony reportedly has made a major impact, with one House Democrat calling it a ""sea change"" and another saying it ""resolved any remaining doubts I may have."" Taken together, the testimony of the public officials that have testified so far paints a damning picture. Had they meekly obeyed the White House's instructions to stay quiet -- as Don McGahn, Mike Pompeo and others did before -- neither Congress nor the public would have had a full understanding of Trump's apparent misuse of office and abuse of power. But by refusing to capitulate, these public servants have caused the White House's previously impregnable stone wall to start to crumble.",VC,,,,,,,

Good question.,"Does it deliver a hefty domestic political payoff, reverse an Obama administration position, upturn international law and irritate the European Union? If so, it's probably a Trump administration foreign policy decision. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday that the US now rejects a 1978 State Department legal opinion that deemed Israeli settlements in the West Bank ""inconsistent with international law."" Like moving the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2017, this dramatic new stance on settlements -- considered illegal by the United Nations and EU -- further deprives the Palestinians of leverage and validates Benjamin Netanyahu's close relationship with Trump at an existential moment for the Israeli PM. Perhaps more important for the US President, Monday's decision is a gift to conservative evangelical voters who support Israel for reasons of biblical prophecy, as well as to his US donors who are also supportive of right-wing politicians in Israel. The administration says the change could bring a just Middle East peace closer, and that it took a year of legal analysis to arrive at this decision. Every president's political leanings naturally influence American foreign policy. But no recent administration has been so keen as Trump's to fracture enduring US policy positions -- even at the risk of infringing US valuesFrom Iran to North Korea to trans-Atlantic relations, this White House has a record of retrofitting policy to match Trump's political bottom line. This summer, Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping that he would keep mum on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong while trade talks took place. And the current impeachment inquiry centers on whether he politicized security aid to Ukraine by pressuring the country's President to investigate Trump's potential political rival Joe Biden.
