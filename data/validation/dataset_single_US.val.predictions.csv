"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was praised for his handling of the attacks on September 11, 2001, but amid divorce proceedings, his wife, Judith Giuliani, criticized him for going from ""hero"" to ""liar."" After 15 years of marriage, the the Giulianis filed for divorce in April. They initially told Page Six they hoped to do it ""as amicably as possible,"" with the former mayor saying there were problems ""on both sides."" However, The New York Times reported the couple's divorce has included fights over kitchen renovations, fountain pens, cigars and the dividing of their assets. They also argued over Rudy's income, which has decreased since he left a law firm to work for President Donald Trump pro bono. Now, the two have a trial date set for January and Judith told The New York Times that court was the only way she could prove his financial worth and receive what she was entitled to. ""I feel betrayed by a man that I supported in every way for more than 20 years,"" Judith said. ""I'm sad to know that the hero of 9/11 has become a liar.""Rudy was first elected mayor of New York City in 1994 and was in his second term when two hijacked planes flew into the World Trade Center. As the city grappled with the developing attacks and the country watched it unfold on television, Rudy, a polarizing figure at the time, emerged as a unifying leader. ""People tonight should say a prayer for the people that we have lost and be grateful that we are all here,"" Rudy said after the towers collapsed. ""Tomorrow New York is going to be here and we are going to rebuild and we are going to be stronger from before.""His actions on 9/11 earned him the title, ""America's Mayor,"" and a spot as Time's Person of the Year in 2001. While Judith criticized Rudy, Bernard Kerik, the former New York police commissioner and Rudy's friend, took aim at Judith for being ""jealous"" and slaughtering Rudy's relationships with his closest friends. Amid accusations of him dating another woman and a desire to withhold money from his wife, Rudy told The New York Times that his personal life wouldn't affect his professional responsibilities. ""When you do what I do, and this could speak for most people in public office, or in demanding jobs, you compartmentalize. Believe it or not in a strange way you might even do better,"" Rudy said about working during a stressful time. ""Because you concentrate harder.""",0
"Democratic presidential hopeful Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has apparently gotten an endorsement she said she can do without — from former KKK leader David Duke. The 68-year-old white supremacist and former GOP Louisiana state senator plastered a banner on his Twitter page prominently featuring a photograph of the Hawaiian lawmaker. “Tulsi Gabbard for President,” it blares, along with the tagline: “Finally a candidate who will actually put America First rather than Israel First!” “Tulsi Gabbard is currently the only Presidential candidate who doesn’t want to send White children off to die for Israel,” the former Grand Wizard tweeted his more than 50,000 followers along with a photograph of Gabbard meeting a US service member and his child. But Gabbard wasted no time in lashing back at Duke and rejected his backing. “I have strongly denounced David Duke’s hateful views and his so-called ‘support’ multiple times in the past, and reject his support,” she told The Post in a statement Tuesday. “Publicizing Duke’s so-called ‘endorsement’ is meant to distract from my message: that I will end regime-change wars, work to end the new cold war and take us away from the precipice of a nuclear war, which is a greater danger now than ever before.” Gabbard — who is of Samoan heritage — served with the US Army National Guard in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and was first elected to office in Hawaii in 2013. The 37-year-old, who announced her White House bid last week, received Duke’s unwelcome endorsement despite several moves signaling her potential support for the Jewish state. In November 2016, Duke tweeted that Gabbard was a representative of a “political realignment” he hoped to see in the US — and called for Donald Trump to appoint her secretary of state. She responded: “U didn’t know I’m Polynesian/Cauc? Dad couldn’t use ‘whites only’ water fountain. No thanks. Ur white nationalism is pure evil.” The following month, she tweeted: “Our movement is one of love/aloha, inclusivity. Duke represents hatred, racism, anti-Semitism, fear. We don’t want his ‘support.’ Period.” In the early 2000s, Gabbard touted working for her father’s anti-gay organization, which sought to pass a measure against same-sex marriage in her state and promoted controversial conversion therapy. In a statement to CNN, she said: “First, let me say I regret the positions I took in the past, and the things I said. I’m grateful for those in the LGBTQ+ community who have shared their aloha with me throughout my personal journey.” Duke also endorsed Trump for president in 2016. When asked by CNN’s Jake Tapper in February that year whether he’d disavow the former Grand Wizard, the then-Republican candidate said: “Just so you understand, I don’t know anything about David Duke, OK?” Duke again praised Trump’s presidency after the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 in which Trump claimed there were “very fine people on both sides.” Duke did not immediately respond to a message for comment Tuesday.",0
"As I write this, the explosive news of Ambassador Bill Taylor’s devastating testimony is rapidly spreading through the Twitterverse and elsewhere. Experts agree that Trump has sustained major damage, and that the Republicans will now be hard pressed to defend him. Surely now he’s finished. To which I say, are you kiddin’ me? The Right Wing propaganda machine, what Jon Stewart called “Bullshit Mountain” is going to go into overdrive now. Does anyone think that the people who slavishly watch Fox’s hideous nighttime lineup will hear ANY objective news about this? Any at all? Do you think that the 1500 right-wing hate radio programs in America will do ANYTHING except rip into the “Demonrats” as we are so affectionately called? Does ANYONE think that The Federalist and RedState and Breitbart and every other right-wing site will do ANYTHING except counterattack? Does ANYONE think that Jordan, Meadows, Gaetz, Nunes, and all the other disgusting Trump Zombies in Congress will do ANYTHING except defend Trump to the utmost, and in the most dishonest, depraved manner possible? Does ANYONE think that the most dangerous man in America, “Attorney General” William Barr, will do ANYTHING except turn the full power of the “Justice” Department on Trump’s enemies? Get serious. You know all the bad news that Trump has been bombarded with lately? You know how Nate Silver’s site generally shows that 42% of likely voters support Trump? Surely his numbers have gone down, right? This morning Trump’s approval among likely voters was 42%. This news about Taylor? I’m sorry, but Taylor is about to be smeared, lied about, and denigrated in the ugliest terms. So what if he is a veteran with a distinguished record? So what if he has decades of service to his country? None of that will mean jack shit to Sean Hannity. Hannity called Robert Mueller a criminal. You think Taylor will get any less hatred than that? My point is this. Yes, we should impeach Trump. Put him on trial in the Senate. But I’m telling you, getting 67 votes to convict is going to be a monumental task. Even if we keep all 47 of our caucus in line (Hiya, Joe Manchin!), who are the 20 Republicans who will vote to convict? Romney, almost certainly. Who else? Gutless coward Rubio? Groveling Trump worshiper Graham? Susan “Concerned” Collins? Gimme names. It’s said that McConnell, “The Gravedigger of Democracy”, will encourage conviction if he thinks keeping Trump in will cost the Republicans the Senate. I don’t buy it. I’ll believe it when I see it. And after Trump is acquitted, and he brags that he has been exonerated, the same 42-43% will still be on his side. And if there is no recession, Trump will be even money to be reelected. If you know me, if you’ve read my work, you know how bitterly I hate the Orange Shitgibbon. The son of a bitch has been RAPING and LOOTING the country of my birth. If I had the power to simply push a button and make him disappear, I would. But I don’t. Don’t you see? Don’t you see? The Right Wingers have been playing the long game. They have spent decades building a propaganda infrastructure of enormous power and influence. This infrastructure’s audience is mostly immune to any criticism of Trump. It does. Not. Matter. what Trump does. It does. Not. Matter. how terrible, corrupt, or harmful his actions are. Bullshit Mountain’s victims simply ignore or reject anything that disturbs their idealized picture of Trump. And, btw, you need to keep this in mind: these people hate us. We are, literally, the worst thing in the world. For over 60 years people like us have been demonized. It has had an effect. A Trump supporter in Tennessee, dying of a treatable condition, said he would rather die than use Obamacare. Trump supporters in Alabama, despite some notable defections, voted overwhelmingly for a Senate candidate credibly accused of pedophilia. Yes, even a pedophile is better than one of us. A Trump supporter recently announced he would rather live under Vladimir Putin (!) than a Democrat. Two Trump supporters were photographed wearing shirts that said, “I’d Rather Be a Russian Than a Democrat”. Hillary Clinton was routinely called “C*nt” by these people in 2016. About a year ago, a poll showed that 17% of Republicans had a positive view of Kim Jong Un, the most barbaric, murderous dictator on the planet. Nancy Pelosi’s positive rating was 15% They. Hate. Us. We will never change them. They will vote to strip themselves of healthcare. They will vote to lose their family farm to the trade war. They will vote to see their public schools ruined. They will vote against their own children’s future. They don’t care. Angering and hurting us is their highest goal. So we must EXPAND the electorate. I’ve flogged this issue again and again and again. But you see, you’ve gotta stop thinking that things like the Taylor testimony will do any harm to Trump politically. I hope I’m wrong. But every. Damned. Day. 42-43%. It never changes. It will not matter if we win the popular vote again in 2020. Hell, we’ve done that 6 out of the past 7 elections. Only ONE number counts. 270. 270, baby. That’s the ballgame. We have to hold every Clinton state and flip several Trump states. No easy task. I have set out a program to help us do just that. This is it (so far): A. We need to PERSONALLY contact, in a face-to-face way, at LEAST 100,000,000 U.S. voters. The reasons we must do that are laid out HERE. B. We must EXPAND the electorate. We must turn out at LEAST 85,000,000 Democratic voters. The groups we most need to target are examined right HERE. C. Registering new voters is KEY. Voter registration information is HERE. D. Each Democratic activist should set a goal of registering at least 10 new Democratic voters. My thoughts on how to do this are HERE. E. We need clear, effective talking points and a clear plan of action. My suggestions for all of these things are HERE. F. You can already donate money to whoever ends up as Trump’s Democratic opponent. That can be done HERE. G. Florida is a MUST-HAVE state, and Puerto Rican voters are crucial. Here’s what needs doing right HERE. H. The women of America are KEY to our victory. Here’s why, HERE. I. Why I am a GOTV fanatic, with some eye-opening stats, right HERE. J. Pennsylvania is KEY. Let’s go for it! Here’s how, right HERE. K. Ohio is KEY. Let’s go for it. Here’s how, right HERE. L. Michigan is KEY. Let’s go for it. Here’s how, right HERE. And in the next few weeks I will have “Let’s Win” diaries for Wisconsin, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Texas, and Arizona as well. It will not be easy. For my part, I will sacrifice anything I need to. But stop holding on to the hope that bad news will sink Trump. All he has to do is stonewall 100% and use Billy Boy Barr to go after his critics and accusers. He can survive this Taylor episode. I hope I’m wrong. But I don’t think I am. Get out the vote. Get out the vote. GET OUT THE G-D DAMNED VOTE. ",1
"A painting the Nazis stole from a Jewish family in the 1930s has been tracked down by the FBI to a museum in New York. The piece titled “Winter,” by American artist Gari Melchers, was on display at the Arkell Museum in Canajoharie until Sept. 10, the Associated Press reported citing federal court documents. It will now remain at the FBI’s office in Albany until it’s returned to its rightful owners. German publisher and philanthropist Rudolf Mosse first acquired the painting from the Great Berlin Art Exhibition in 1900. After his family members fled Germany in 1933, the Nazi government then seized control of the Mosse family's art collection. The Nazis had persecuted the family because they were Jewish and because of their affiliations with Berliner Tageblatt, a newspaper critical of the party, according to court documents viewed by the Associated Press. Bartlett Arkell, the first president of the Beech-Nut Packing Company, bought the painting from a New York City gallery in 1934 for his personal collection. It later became part of the collection at the museum that bears his name, 50 miles northwest of Albany. Suzan D. Friedlander, the museum's executive director and chief curator, told the Associated Press that the Arkell Museum ""was of course very upset to learn the history of the painting's seizure from the Mosse family by the Nazis in 1933."" The museum has waived all its rights to the painting. ",0
"Purdue Pharma, the maker of the opioid drug OxyContin, has reached a tentative deal worth billions of dollars that would resolve thousands of lawsuits brought by municipal and state governments who sued the company for allegedly helping to fuel the opioid crisis. The pending settlement likely means Purdue will avoid going to trial in the sprawling and complicated case involving some 2,300 local governments across 23 states. Lawyer Paul Farrell, one of the lead attorneys representing more than 2,000 local governments that have filed suit against Purdue, said the Sackler family, which owns the privately-held drug company, will pay roughly $3 billion dollars in cash over several years and relinquish control of the company. Details of the deal ⁠— like how the money will be divvied up — are still being worked out. The settlement, if enacted, would mean Purdue will file for bankruptcy and divest from pharmaceutical holdings worldwide. ""Which means the people who were front and center in causing this epidemic, in my view, won't be able to go out and repeat their playbook in Asia, South America or Africa,"" Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, who is part of the pending deal, told NPR. Under the terms of the proposal, future revenue from the sale of OxyContin would go into a trust designed to help communities struggling with the opioid epidemic. The tentative deal would relaunch the Purdue company under non-Sackler ownership. The newly formed company will be managed by a group of trustees. ""That company and whether it continues in business to sell non-opioid drugs, or continues for a period of time to sell OxyContin under appropriate standards with appropriate marketing for appropriate uses is still being decided,"" said Joe Rice, another lead lawyer representing the municipalities. ""It's a big open question."" More than a dozen other drug makers, distributors and pharmacy chains still face a federal opioid trial next month in Ohio that's considered a test case for establishing the pharmaceutical industry's liability. Late Wednesday, in a separate ruling, the judge presiding over that case approved a dramatic expansion of the number of communities that could benefit from future class action suit leveled against drug makers. Under U.S. District Judge Dan Polster's ruling, tens of thousands of cities, counties and other local governments across the U.S. will now automatically be included in opioid-related settlements with the pharmaceutical industry going forward, unless they opt out. But Polster's decision does not apply to Purdue Pharma's pending settlement, where details are expected to be hammered out in the coming months in a consolidated bankruptcy proceeding. While Purdue Pharma's tentative settlement would bring some relief to communities, a growing number of state attorneys general are lining up against the deal. They want the Sackler family to pay far more out of their personal fortune, valued by Forbes magazine at roughly $13 billion. New York Attorney General Letitia James said the settlement shows the Sacklers' ""attempting to evade responsibility and lowball millions of victims of the opioids crisis."" Others attorneys general from such states as Connecticut and North Carolina echoed this criticism. Some have promised separate lawsuits against the Sacklers in an attempt to hold them accountable and win payouts for the families of victims of the opioid crisis. ""Our position remains firm and unchanged and nothing for us has changed today,"" Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. ""The scope and scale of the pain, death and destruction that Purdue and the Sacklers have caused far exceeds anything that has been offered thus far,"" Tong said. ""Connecticut's focus is on the victims and their families, and holding Purdue and the Sacklers accountable for the crisis they have caused."" Yost of Ohio acknowledge that there is a camp of discontented attorneys general who may never be satisfied with the settlement. ""There's a proposal that a lot of folks have signed on to. I don't think we have critical mass,"" Yost said. ""But we're working on it."" Yet Farrell, representing the more than 2,000 other entities, said the first comprehensive settlement, which is a step closer to being approved by a bankruptcy judge, is a major development in the fight to curb opioid-related deaths in America. ""To be able to take down this Goliath and to have some type of justice of putting them out of business is an indication of the consequences a lot of these companies have moving forward with this litigation,"" Farrell said. Purdue has pointed out that its products were approved by the Federal Drug Administration and that doctors were prescribing them to address patient pain. But the plaintiffs in the suit say company officials aggressively marketed opioids and downplayed the addictive risks, creating what they said was the prelude of the opioid crisis. In March, Purdue and members of the Sackler family agreed to pay $270 million settlement and to pay legal fees to Oklahoma to avoid a trial over the company's role in the opioid crisis in that state. In a statement, Purdue Pharma said it ""continues to work with all plaintiffs on reaching a comprehensive resolution to its opioid litigation that will deliver billions of dollars and vital opioid overdose rescue medicines to communities across the country impacted by the opioid crisis.""",0
"""CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — The Australian man accused of killing 51 people and wounding dozens more in a terrorist attack on two mosques in New Zealand will be tried in the city of Christchurch, where the shooting occurred, after he told his legal team on Thursday to withdraw his application to have it moved to another city. Brenton Tarrant pleaded not guilty in June to 51 counts of murder and 39 of attempted murder following the attack in March on Muslims at al-Noor and Linwood mosques during Friday prayers. His lawyers had earlier requested that he be tried in New Zealand’s largest city, Auckland, and a hearing was convened for Thursday to hear their arguments. The courtroom’s public gallery was packed with survivors of the attacks, members of the victims’ families and senior police officers working the case. Some of those affected had strong views about whether the trial — which is expected to take at least six weeks — should be moved to Auckland, about 475 miles north of the city where the attacks happened, which would have made it difficult for many to attend all the court sessions."" But Shane Tait, one of Mr. Tarrant’s lawyers, told the judge that his client was withdrawing the request. Mr. Tarrant, dressed in prison garb, appeared in court via video link, rather than in person, as is common in procedural hearings in New Zealand. At the end of the hearing, just before the video link was cut, he cupped his hand around his mouth and yelled something — but his microphone had already been faded and the words were not discernible. Wasseim Alsati, who was shot in the attack along with his 4-year-old daughter, and is still walking with crutches, said outside court that he was pleased the trial would be held in Christchurch. He said that he, along with other survivors, had been prepared to travel to Auckland but was glad he would not have to. Still, he was upset to see Mr. Tarrant’s demeanor in the video link. “He was absolutely happy. Laughing, smiling, not even giving any respect to the courtroom and to the judge,” Mr. Alsati said. “This is really bad behavior, really unacceptable behavior.” After the hearing, relatives and survivors were left baffled outside the courtroom, where they had expected to hear arguments about the proposed change in venue, as court staff members explained the proceedings to them. In the months after Mr. Tarrant’s arrest, New Zealand’s court system was criticized by some of the victims’ families and their advocates because initial hearings were scheduled for Fridays, the sacred day for Muslims and the day of the week that the attack took place. The hearings were switched to Thursdays in recent months, after families complained. The Justice Ministry earlier said it had introduced new cultural and language services at the court house, including a prayer room, in response to feedback from the community. The judge, Cameron Mander, has also adjusted the potential trial date. The trial was initially set for May 2020, during Ramadan, the holy month of prayer and fasting for Muslims, and officials appeared not to have realized the conflict. The trial, which is expected to run at least six weeks, is now scheduled to begin on June 2. The scale of the Christchurch case is unprecedented in a country that has never tried a mass shooting of anywhere near this size, and it is expected to challenge the court system. Seating for court hearings will be in high demand, with dozens of survivors and victims’ relatives, and a large international news media contingent. Security risks will also confront the court; at a June hearing in Mr. Tarrant’s case, a man was charged after he played pro-Nazi music outside the court and confronted a survivor of the attacks. Mr. Tarrant’s guards at the prison in Auckland where he is being held, the country’s only maximum security facility, were embarrassed in August when they were forced to admit that he had sent letters to supporters from his cell. At least one, which was posted on the message board 4chan, contained a call for racist violence. New Zealand’s government said at the time that the letters of prisoners who held white supremacist views would be inspected by a specialist team. Christine Stevenson, the chief executive of New Zealand’s corrections department, said the agency had never managed a prisoner like Mr. Tarrant before and the risk he presented was “unprecedented.” ",0
"The debate is 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern time. It is being held in Atlanta and co-hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post. There will be no opening statements. Candidates will have 75 seconds to answer questions from the moderators: Rachel Maddow of MSNBC, Andrea Mitchell and Kristen Welker of NBC and Ashley Parker of The Washington Post. Each candidate will have 45 seconds for rebuttals or follow-ups, as well as a 75-second closing statement. The New York Times will have extensive debate coverage, including a live analysis throughout the event. Ten Democratic presidential candidates will take the debate stage in Atlanta on Wednesday night, but the spotlight is likely to follow two contenders who have risen to the top of polls over the last several months: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Here is what to watch for as the candidates debate: How will Warren handle jabs from her rivals? Last month in Ohio, Ms. Warren took incoming fire from four different rivals. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Buttigieg led the attack against her health care proposals, Senator Kamala Harris of California made a disjointed plea for Ms. Warren to sign onto her call for Twitter to ban President Trump and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii demanded to know how Ms. Warren was qualified to serve as commander-in-chief. Since then, Ms. Warren has seen her polling position diminish as she has sought to explain how she would finance “Medicare for all” beyond the “I’m with Bernie” line that she offered earlier in the campaign. But the attacks against her haven’t stopped. She remains a useful foil for Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg — along with Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota — as they jostle to be the standard-bearer for the party’s moderate wing. Ms. Warren has shown no indication she’s willing to give ground. During a speech to Iowa Democrats this month she used the word “fight” 21 times in 12 minutes. Her argument that the party will lose to Mr. Trump if it nominates a candidate who fears her bold proposals has become central to her campaign stump speech. Expect both dynamics to be on full display in Atlanta, though this time Ms. Warren will be prepared to defend Medicare for all in a more detailed fashion than she has demonstrated to date. The Pete pile-on is coming For weeks, aggravation about Mr. Buttigieg among his rivals has been simmering. It’s about to boil over Wednesday night. With the 37-year-old holding a commanding first-place position in the latest Des Moines Register poll, his opponents are ready to attack him. Ms. Harris said Mr. Buttigieg would “have to answer” for using a stock photograph from Kenya to illustrate his plan for African-Americans on his campaign website. Ms. Klobuchar has taken her quiet asides about his lack of experience to the Sunday talk shows. And Ms. Warren dismissed Mr. Buttigieg for running a “consultant-driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed not to offend anyone.” At the same time, the volume of opposition research being pitched by rival campaigns about Mr. Buttigieg has increased, focusing on 9-year-old friendly remarks about the Tea Party and his stewardship of the municipal government in South Bend. In previous debates, Mr. Buttigieg has easily parried attacks from his rivals — that task will become tougher as scrutiny on him increases. Will Bernie Sanders finally pressure Warren? While Ms. Warren laid out a plan last week to pass a full Medicare for all system by her third year in the White House, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said he’d get it done right away. “I will engage that struggle on day one of my administration,” Mr. Sanders said Friday in California. “Not put it off for several years.” Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, long ideological partners, have mostly avoided direct conflict on the campaign trail. But the Medicare for all issue affords each of them an opportunity to create political distance. Mr. Sanders can once again brand himself as the purest advocate for his political revolution. Ms. Warren, meanwhile, will have to navigate between appealing to the party’s most progressive voters and not frightening away moderate Democrats by tying herself too closely to Mr. Sanders. Medicare for all who want to debate about it The Democratic differences on how to fix America’s health care system have consumed much of the airtime in debate after debate, and the coming clash in Atlanta is expected to be more of the same. In the last debate, Ms. Warren was hammered for lacking her own Medicare for all plan. She has since rolled out a comprehensive package that more moderate Democrats, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, have said is unrealistic and unworkable. Mr. Biden has used health care to raise other questions about Ms. Warren, calling her an elitist with a “my way or the highway” approach to governance. Mr. Buttigieg has been advertising in Iowa to promote his “Medicare for all who want it” approach, which Ms. Warren has said will not fundamentally fix the system. The recent Des Moines Register/CNN poll showed how divided the party is on the topic, with 36 percent favoring a Medicare for all plan that eliminates private insurance, 34 percent wanting a “public option” and 20 percent saying they preferred restoring provisions in the Affordable Care Act. A split-screen on impeachment Midway through the second week of impeachment gobbling the entire Washington news cycle, the presidential candidates would still rather talk about almost anything else. Yet it seems implausible — if not impossible — for Wednesday night’s debate moderators to avoid asking the White House hopefuls about the House inquiry unfolding daily on live television. But what can the candidates say at this point? They’re all for impeaching Mr. Trump. But while they know that wanting the president removed from office is the cost of entry for the Democratic primary, voters would much rather see a discussion about the sort of issues that are central to their daily lives: health care, climate change and the economy. Even Tom Steyer, the California billionaire who spent years on a campaign calling for Mr. Trump’s impeachment, is talking about other issues on the trail. So expect to see the moderators quiz the candidates about the latest developments from Washington, as they then pivot to something else. Can Kamala Harris recover? Things are not going well for the California senator. Since the last debate, she has shuttered her New Hampshire offices. She has laid off staff and shifted resources from her Baltimore headquarters to Iowa. And she has continued a slide in the polls, which now show her closer to the bottom tier than to the top. The challenge is that Ms. Harris has already delivered one of the most memorable debate moments of the primary — her takedown of Mr. Biden on busing — but the bump she received quickly faded. She has since turned her focus on Mr. Trump in one debate, and challenged Ms. Warren to call for kicking the president off Twitter in another. She does not have a signature policy focus — she has called to cut middle-class taxes as a top priority — that seems ripe to pop. It is not clear what tack she will take on Wednesday evening (she could be among the many ready to pile onto Mr. Buttigieg), but the pressure to perform is strong. ",0
"You probably can’t name the creator or explain the origins of the ""This is fine"" internet meme, but if you spend any time on social media, you’ve probably seen it used recently in response to news of dire calamity, both real and perceived. The ""This is fine"" meme is a perfectly succinct way to illustrate that most persistent of reactions to whatever trouble may surround us: denial. The meme — which depicts a cartoon dog sipping coffee as the room he’s sitting in literally goes up in flames — hails from a 2013 edition of the well-known webcomic Gun Show, created by K.C. Green. The full comic carries the joke even further: Out of context, the meme is usually used to suggest that you are ignoring some drama that’s happening around you. Sometimes, it’s also used to hint that you’re secretly celebrating said drama. The latter case is likely more representative of the GOP Twitter account’s deployment of the meme on Monday evening. Perhaps the GOP’s social media manager meant to imply that the Democrats selecting Clinton as their presidential candidate this week at the Democratic National Convention were the ones in denial about the damage being done to their party as the result of their choice. Or perhaps the Republicans were simply celebrating what they saw as a Democratic meltdown. The GOP’s meme reference didn’t work out as planned In any case, the party’s use of the meme drew swift backlash — not only from Democrats, but from fans of the meme’s origin. Comics collective TopatoCo, which distributes merchandise for a number of popular webcomics including Gun Show, sent the following message to the party: Meanwhile, Green himself more or less gritted his teeth to the pain of seeing his artwork appropriated by the polarizing right-wing: But the joke was on the GOP; Green had already anticipated the meme’s use in the current political climate — and not in a way that’s flattering to the Republicans. Popular political webcomic The Nib, which publishes satire by a variety of artists, recently commissioned Green to create a special variant of ""This is fine"" for its Philadelphia gallery show, which overlaps the Democratic National Convention this week. The artwork Green made actually shows a GOP elephant sitting in its own burning house — a reference to the controversially extreme, arguably racist views espoused by GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. Apparently the irony was too great for The Nib to resist pointing out to the GOP’s Twitter: The Nib’s dig at the GOP for using Green’s image without paying for it is a sly one, but it ignores the complicated statuses of images that become viral internet memes. The subject of paying artists and content creators whose works go viral and then seemingly become the collective property of whoever wants to use them online is always a controversial one in the remix-heavy culture of the internet. But Green, who’s about to launch a Kickstarter for an adorable plushie version of the ""This is Fine"" dog, generally tries not to row against the stream of viral internet success. He had more thoughts on the GOP tweet to share Tuesday: On Twitter, GOP supporters and detractors alternately mocked and lauded the idea that a creator’s opinion should have any bearing on how their work gets used. Green’s experience follows that of a litany of musicians who have protested the GOP’s use of their music; most recently, the estate of George Harrison lambasted Trump’s use of ""Here Comes the Sun"" and Luciano Pavarotti’s widow asked Trump to stop using the late tenor’s recording of the famous Puccini aria ""Nessun Dorma"" on the campaign trail. Of course, Trump has bigger problem on his hands than pop culture artists decrying his use of their works. But for many anti-Trump voters, mocking Republican attempts to use internet jokes probably provides a much-needed distraction from a bitter and contentious election cycle. In fact, it’s almost like enjoying a cup of tea while the house burns down around you.",0
"Firefighters are still trying to stop the fires that have ravaged much of the Amazon Rainforest. The Washington Post reported on a group of ""elite"" local firefighters, known as the ""guerreiros de fogo"" or ""fire warriors,"" who are still fighting fires in Mato Gross, Brazil. Led by former US Army paratrooper John Carter, these local, well-trained firefighters cover hundreds of miles each day putting out or containing fires. And they're making a difference. They're also not the only ones fighting fires in the Amazon. In Brazil, after international condemnation about the state of the rainforest, President Jair Bolsonaro sent in 44,000 troops to douse fires at the end of August. Bolivia also 5,000 soldiers to fight the forest fires in its chunk of the Amazon. Here's what it's like for the ""fire warriors"" on the frontlines. In August, Brazil's rainforest was burning the most since 2010. At one point, 31,000 fires were burning ... ... which created a 1.2 million-square-mile layer of smoke. After facing intense scrutiny from the international community, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro agreed to send in 44,000 troops to fight the fires at the end of August. By September, the number of fires burning had fallen to 20,000 — a six year low. It's unusual, because September is usually when fires increase. For comparison, 24,500 fires burned in September 2018. And it's likely that the decrease is a mix of Brazil's military fighting the fires and more rain, Maria Silva Dias, a professor and forest fire expert at the University of Sao Paulo, told Reuters. Fires, many of which were started on purpose to clear land for farming, have burned indiscriminately — in parks, ranches, government land, and indigenous land. At the end of August, Bolsonaro also issued a 60-day ban on starting fires. Here, a firefighter from the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) attempts to control the direction of the fire on indigenous land in September. Another member of IBAMA fire brigades extinguishes the smoldering remains of a fire here. Before the fires broke out this year, Bolsonaro spoke about shutting down the organization, because he wanted forested regions to be developed. The government still sent them in, though, and barred members from speaking to the media. Some of the firefighters wield eight-foot poles with mats attached to the end, and slap them down on the fires. Or they shoot water from hoses attached to water tanks, like a ""child's Super Soaker,"" ABC News reported. They use all of the tools they have on hand. Water bags are refilled from nearby streams ... dirt is shoveled on to fires to suffocate them ... and from the sky, fighter jets dump water and fire retardant onto fires. The Brazilian government also hired a Boeing 747-400, which is capable of dropping 19,000 gallons per trip, to assist. But for the most part, firefighters' tools are rudimentary. And the Amazon is so large that firefighters can't stop many of the fires. In Bolivia, at least 4.2 million acres of forest have burned. The government sent in 5,000 troops to battle the fires, and said it has spent $20 million on the fight. The fires became so bad Bolivian President Evo Morales put his re-election campaign on hold to fight the fires. Despite his firsthand efforts to help, environmentalists have criticized him for passing laws that encourage slash and burning to make room for farmland. Some volunteer firefighters in Bolivia worked by night to keep cool, and to be able to see the fires more clearly. Here, it's police and military working as a group to stop a fire, but farmers, accountants, and construction workers have also made up the crews fighting Bolivia's fires. Often, they're doing it with donated gear, including fire hoses that are full of holes. It's dangerous work. A volunteer named Andres Manaca was nearly trapped by fires twice over an eight-day period he spent fighting them. At one point he was in a group of volunteers who had to flee as the fire came for them. “It was violent, like lightning,” he told The Guardian. And it's not always a rewarding job, in the traditional sense. One firefighter chief told ABC News he was aware fighting the flames was futile, but if they could save a few things, it was worth it. Not everyone thinks firefighters have made a difference. Retired colonel Angelo Robelo, who has fought poachers and monitored fires in the Amazon for 30 years, told ABC News only mother nature could make a difference. But it appears they have made an impact. Bolivia's armed forces commander said there was no plan to withdraw the troops. So for now, the firefighters will continue on. And soldiers, like this one, will continue to monitor the progress of one of the worst years for Amazon Rainforest fires in recent history. ",0
"LuLaRoe, the controversial multilevel marketing company that has faced a barrage of lawsuits over the past few years, is laying off all 167 employees at its California warehouse. The embattled company announced its plans to cut the workers in an Oct. 20 letter to the Employment Development Department of California (EDD). The company did so because state law dictates that employers inform the EDD and affected employees 60 days before conducting a ""plant closing or mass layoff."" In the letter obtained by BuzzFeed News, LuLaRoe said it will ""permanently lay-off [its] warehouse workforce"" in Corona five days before Christmas. Every employee — from the warehouse's maintenance engineer to forklift drivers — will be affected. In a statement to BuzzFeed News, LuLaRoe confirmed the warehouse will be permanently closed and the company's shipping operations will be moved to its distribution center in South Carolina. ""Understanding the significant impact this decision would have in the lives of so many families and the local community—this decision was not made lightly; and was a sole effort to meet the immediate and long term business and operational demands needed to continue pioneering the social retail industry,"" a spokesperson for LuLaRoe said. The spokesperson added they are connecting the employees with staffing agencies, ""knowing they will continue to succeed and shine on the road ahead."" The Press-Enterprise first reported that the company had informed the EDD of the layoffs. The last few years have been rough for LuLaRoe. The company made a name for itself by signing up thousands of women to sell its popular, comfy leggings and reportedly selling $2.3 billion worth of products in 2017 alone. Pretty soon, however, angry former consultants began to speak out. They filed class-action lawsuits in 2017, claiming they had been hoodwinked into nothing more than a ""pyramid scheme."" Women told BuzzFeed News that same year they had lost thousands of dollars trying to start their LuLaRoe businesses, leaving many of them in debt. Dozens of former consultants ended up filing for bankruptcy. In 2018, the company's main clothing supplier, Providence Industries, sued LuLaRoe for $49 million, claiming it hadn't been paid. And the legal cases haven't stopped: Another class-action lawsuit filed in Washington state earlier this year accused the company of being a fraud.",0
"Rep. Elijah Cummings, the powerful House Democrat who represented Baltimore for more than two decades and was a vocal critic of President Trump, died early Thursday after battling health problems, his office and family said. Cummings, who was 68, died at Gilchrist Hospice Care, a Johns Hopkins affiliate. As chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, he was one of the most powerful Democrats in Washington, and played a key role in the House Democrats' ongoing efforts to impeach Trump. Tributes poured in Thursday from lawmakers and others in politics on both sides of the aisle. “I was shocked and saddened to learn the news this morning of my dear friend’s passing,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a fellow Maryland Democrat, said in a statement. ""Elijah Cummings was a man of principle, patriotism, and conviction, whose loss will be deeply felt throughout the State of Maryland and our country."" At the White House, the flag was lowered to half-staff. ""My warmest condolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings,"" Trump tweeted. ""I got to see first hand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard, if not impossible, to replace!"" Cummings' office said in a brief statement that he died ""due to complications concerning longstanding health challenges."" Cummings had been in ill health the past few years, navigating the Capitol in a motorized cart and using a walker. ""He worked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity,"" his wife, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, said Thursday. Cummings did not return to work after an undisclosed medical procedure that he said would only keep him away for about a week. The New York Times reported that Cummings had heart surgery in 2017 and had a bacterial infection in his knee. Cummings was known for driving himself back and forth from Baltimore and Washington -- sometimes multiple times a day -- to make committee hearings, floor votes and attend to issues in his district. In the House, Cummings built a substantial power base. At the time of his death, he was chairman of the influential House Oversight Committee and a leading voice in the Congressional Black Caucus. He played a key role in the impeachment inquiry into Trump. However, Cummings had not been seen the past few weeks at closed-door interviews, alongside House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel. However, every subpoena, document request or statement which was issued on impeachment of late was done in the name of all three committee chairs. New York Rep. Carolyn Maloney is next in seniority to take over the gavel of the committee. The committee postponed a planned hearing Thursday. ""My heart is broken, as I weep personally and for his family and community,"" Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said. ""Elijah Cummings’ unmatched integrity and leadership leaves a remarkable legacy."" ""There was no stronger advocate and no better friend than Elijah Cummings,"" said North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, a Republican on the Oversight Committee who often sparred with Cummings. ""I am heartbroken for his wonderful family and staff—please pray for them. I will miss him dearly."" During the Obama years, Cummings -- as the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee -- was known as a relentless defender of the administration during high-profile congressional probes, including during the investigation of the Benghazi attacks. Cummings was born on Jan. 18, 1951. In grade school, a counselor told Cummings he was too slow to learn and spoke poorly, and he would never fulfill his dream of becoming a lawyer. ""I was devastated,"" Cummings told The Associated Press in 1996, shortly before he won his seat in Congress. ""My whole life changed. I became very determined."" Cummings, a sharecropper's son and one of seven children, led multiple investigations of the president's governmental dealings, including probes in 2019 relating to the president's family members serving in the White House. He clashed with Trump after the president criticized his district as a ""rodent-infested mess"" where ""no human being would want to live."" Cummings replied that government officials must stop making ""hateful, incendiary comments"" that only serve to divide and distract the nation from its real problems, including mass shootings and white supremacy. ""Those in the highest levels of the government must stop invoking fear, using racist language and encouraging reprehensible behavior,"" Cummings said in a speech at the National Press Club.",1
"Here’s the full statement from ABC News: At the time, not all of our reporting met our standards to air, but we never stopped investigating the story. Ever since we’ve had a team on this investigation and substantial resources dedicated to it. That work has led to a two-hour documentary and 6-part podcast that will air in the new year. Here is the pertinent part of Robach’s statement: As a journalist, as the Epstein story continued to unfold last summer, I was caught in a private moment of frustration. I was upset that an important interview I had conducted with Virginia Roberts didn’t air because we could not obtain sufficient corroborating evidence to meet ABC’s editorial standards about her allegations. On Tuesday morning, O’Keefe released video of Good Morning America co-host Robach, on set, voicing her anger at ABC News for spiking her 2015 reporting on Epstein, the well-heeled Democrat donor who died mysteriously in prison after being arrested for various sexual crimes, including trafficking. She says Epstein accuser Virginia Guiffre had the goods, and then some, including photographs. Robach names former President Bill Clinton, Alan Dershowitz, and Prince Andrew. All three deny any wrongdoing. “I’ve had this interview with Virginia [Guiffre],” Robach says of the year 2015. “We would not put it on the air. I was told, ‘Who’s Jeffrey Epstein? No one knows who that is. This is a stupid story.’” “I had it all three years ago,” she adds. “She had pictures. She had everything.” Of Prince Andrew, she says ABC “quashed the story” out of the fear the Palace would not allow the network to interview “Kate and Will.” “It was unbelievable what we had. We had Clinton. We had everything.” Robach says Attorney Brad Edwards told her that “there will come a day when we will realize Jeffrey Epstein was the most prolific pedophile this country has ever known.” In the video below, O’Keefe points out how far apart the candid video is from Robach’s ridiculous statement. He also promises more to come:Robach’s statement is absurd. In a moment of candor, she does not appear to be bragging; she does not come off like someone who is puffing herself up to impress someone else. And her frustration is not aimed at NOT being able to nail down the story. She’s furious because she HAD the story, and the revelations coming out three years after she had it confirm her reporting… and ABC News “quashed” it. That’s her word… “quashed.” And why, when it comes to a friend of the Clintons, when it comes to a high-profile Democrat donor, are we supposed to believe the same ABC News that was happy to spend three years pushing the totally bogus and never confirmed Russia Collusion Hoax, suddenly had an attack of ethical journalism over an already-convicted sex offender? Well, no one believes that and shame on Amy Robach for toeing the company line. Shame on ABC News for putting “Will and Kate” above all the Epstein victims who might have been warned off years ago by this reporting, and don’t ever let yourself forget that ABC is owned by the Walt Disney Company, and that Disney will always protect the Clintons, but not your children. Let’s not forget that 2015, the year ABC quashed this, Hillary Clinton was gearing up her presidential run. Let’s not forget Clintonista George Stephanopoulos is the big star at ABC News. And let’s not forget that during some of this same time, NBC was covering up for Clinton friend and big time Democrat donor Harvey Weinstein.",0
"On Thursday’s broadcast of ABC’s “The View,” co-host Meghan McCain asked Donald Trump Jr. if President Donald Trump attacking people makes him “feel good?” McCain said, “Mr. Trump, a lot of Americans in politics miss character. And a lot of people miss the soul of this country. You and your family have hurt a lot of people, and put a lot of people through a lot of pain, including the Khan family, who was a gold star family that I think should be respected for the loss of their son. Does all this make you feel good?” Trump said, “I don’t think any of that makes me feel good, but I do think that we got into this because we wanted to do what’s right for America,” Don Jr. replied. My father has been working tirelessly to bring back the American dream who have watched politicians with no business experience send that American dream abroad to countries that hate our guts. He has brought jobs back. He has created unprecedented levels of unemployment numbers for African-Americans. McCain said, “Character in politics, I believe, is important. It was how I was raised. It’s the way I view the lens of America. I understand what you are saying about policy, but when you are talking about attacking Gold Star families, who have given the ultimate sacrifice more than anyone in this room has given, and you put them through pain. Does it make you feel like this was worth it?” Trump said, “He calls a lot of those Gold Star families, and he has a lot of care for those people.” McCain said, “He should call the Khans and apologize.” Trump said, “He was under constant attack by the same people. When he’s under attack by the establishment, but the reality is, he’s a counterpuncher. And as a conservative, I would hope you would appreciate that conservatives haven’t been known for fighting back for a very long time. We have ceded ground to the liberals and the liberal elite for decades by not actually fighting back. I understand we can keep going back to character. I think he has great character.” McCain said, “It’s just for me, it would not have been worth it. This would not have been worth it. And I think people can go to the moment when my dad stopped someone from saying Obama was a Muslim. And the pain — inflicting pain on so many people, wouldn’t have been worth it to me or my family to get in the White House. So I just want to know: Is it worth it?” Trump said, “I think it depends on the hat that I’m wearing. For me, as a citizen and a father of kids in New York City, you know, it hasn’t exactly been peaches and cream for us either. It is worth it when I go around the country, and I see people affected by these policies getting to live their American dream again. When I see, it’s happening with those people, and they tell me their stories how they’re so happy they voted for my father. They’re so happy he had the guts to take on those people, to not just accept the status quo.”",1

" (CNN)Oh, the arrogance. I was recently talking to one of my friends, a former Bill Clinton operative, about the unique properties a special category of people have in common. The category is Humans Who Run for President of the United States. The unique properties are, in a word, an outsized sense of self. A level of arrogance is, by definition, required. Imagine believing you can solve unwieldy, complex, centuries-old, systemic problems that others heretofore have not, that your singular genetic and experiential alchemy makes you the best person to lead a nation, that you can in fact defeat dozens of other capable and qualified candidates to be the last man or woman standing. Then imagine thinking all that, while being one of the most divisive politicians to run for president -- and fail twice, once to a member of your own party and once to Donald J. Trump. Welcome to Hillary Clinton's mind. Clinton, once again, refused this week to rule out a 2020 presidential bid, insisting she was hearing from plenty of people who wanted her to jump in. ""I, as I say, never, never, never say never,"" she said in a radio interview Tuesday. ""I will certainly tell you, I'm under enormous pressure from many, many, many people to think about it."" This echoes other flirtations, including a tweet warning Trump, ""Don't tempt me."" Good grief. This Democratic field of candidates is the most diverse in the history of the presidency. There's not only a racial and ethnic diversity of backgrounds, but a diversity of experience -- there are senators, congressional members, past and current mayors, governors, businessmen and even a self-help guru. There's also a diversity of ideas, from far-left progressive policies to more moderate and incremental views of how to fix broken systems. There's a diversity of age and geographical appeal. If voters can't find something they like from this field, it likely doesn't exist. And it's finally begun to consolidate, with voters lining up behind a handful of frontrunner candidates. This is the way it's supposed to go -- the process is working just fine, despite the anxieties of Democratic donors who believe a late entrant like Hillary Clinton or Michael Bloomberg is needed to save Democratic voters from themselves. But Clinton, especially, isn't the answer. While she won the popular vote in 2016, she's hardly popular. According to an October Fox News poll, 54% of registered voters have a negative opinion of her. Only 41% have a positive opinion. Over the course of the yearlong election, her unfavorable ratings went up -- starting at 51% unfavorable in November 2015, and ending at 54.4% unfavorable in November 2016, according to Real Clear Politics' poll average. In short, the more people saw, the less they liked. As polarizing as Trump was and is, so too was Clinton. In May of 2016, as FiveThirtyEight noted, both Clinton and Trump were more strongly disliked than any nominee at that point in the past 10 presidential cycles. You'd think that nearly three years of Trump's divisive rhetoric, his utter incompetence, his embarrassing foibles on the world stage, would have put a fresh coat of paint on Clinton's reputation. You'd think wrong. Even now, she is outpolled by her fellow Democrats in the primary, all of whom are more popular now than she was in 2016. If this doesn't sound like a recipe for success in 2020, well, you must be people not named Hillary Clinton, who still seems to think she could be what the nation is clamoring for. But that's not because the nation is thinking -- a whopping 75% of Democratic voters are satisfied with the current field. More likely, nostalgia for what could have been is clouding the judgment of those who wish she were running now, including, perhaps, Clinton herself: ""Look, I think all the time about what kind of president I would've been and what I would've done differently and what I think it would've meant to our country and our world,"" she said Tuesday.

"The crowd is on their feet and chanting his name before he even takes the stage. ""Tauren! Tauren! Tauren!"" An electric guitarist unleashes a series of triumphant power chords as fans hold their smartphone cameras aloft, the glowing screens dotting the darkened concert hall like fireflies. Young women squeal as an athletic young man in form-fitting gray pants with pink stripes runs onto the stage and faces them with a huge smile. ""Don' leave me up here by myself. Let me hear you scream!"" he shouts as the audience roars in response. It's another sell-out crowd at Center Stage for Tauren Wells, one of the biggest stars in Christian contemporary music. The five-time Grammy nominee puts on a show that features plenty of impassioned singing, an assortment of moonwalks, ""popping and locking"" street-dance moves and mini-sermons about his faith. Yet there is one subject that Wells' supple vocal range won't reach. He won't sing about hot-button political issues, and he certainly won't criticize President Trump. ""I would never oppose a president because I believe in what scripture says about giving honor to authority,"" the genial 33-year-old entertainer says in a brief interview before his show. ""That doesn't mean that I agree with everything. But I believe that an attack on authority anywhere is an attack on authority everywhere.""Critics have skewered white evangelicals for their steadfast support of Trump, a man that author Ben Howe says has flouted Christian values and ""lived most of his life actively, and unapologetically, in opposition to them."" But there is one group of evangelical leaders who has largely escaped scrutiny: stars of contemporary Christian music, also known as CCM. Many of them will gather in Nashville tonight for the 50th Annual GMA (Gospel Music Association) Dove Awards, inspirational music's version of the Grammys. These CCM stars pack megachurches, amass big social media followings and command some of the biggest platforms in the evangelical world. Michael W. Smith has sold more than 15 million albums and sang at the 2004 Republican National Convention, while singer Chris Tomlin has sold more than 8 million albums and played New York's Madison Square Garden, to name a few. These artists, and many others like them, have become spiritual brands. What's most striking about these artists, though, is not what they sing. It's what they leave out of their songs. Christians? Or copouts? The America these artists love to evoke in their songs is stuck in what one columnist called a ""hideous loop of hate."" White supremacists march in public chanting, ""Jews will not replace us."" A man guns down Latino shoppers in an El Paso Wal-Mart. School shootings now seem almost as frequent as proms. The President demonizes immigrants and tweets racist insults. These issues aren't just political, they're moral. Yet little of these ugly realities make their way into CCM, which is now dominated by upbeat praise and worship music. There are occasional calls for racial tolerance in some songs like Mandisa's ""Bleed the Same."" But if someone is looking for righteous anger at how the ""least of these"" is treated in America, some critics say they won't find it in Christian contemporary music.Is it time for Christian musicians to start speaking out more on the widening political and racial divisions in the Trump era? Or should they keep performing songs that focus on love, not division? For some, those questions present a false choice. They say CCM artists are already offering the best solution for political battles in the Trump era: the Prince of Peace, or what some call Jesus. ""There are ton of a people who think that the most relevant, extreme message you can give in times like this is to stop being hateful and love other people,"" says Dan Keen, who teaches students about the music business at Belmont University in Nashville. Keen believes that just because most CCM artists don't hammer Trump or his immigration policies doesn't mean they're Christian copouts. Many of these artists are involved in charitable causes and other ministries that people ignore, says Keen, who has worked at a Christian music label and served on the GMA's board of directors. One example of the widespread altruism in the CCM field is Smith, now an elder statesmen. He has raised funds to battle AIDS in Africa. ""I don't think they're dodging anything,"" Keen says. "" I see them trying to further the cause of Christ and being Christ-like in their behavior."" Why many CCM artists avoid politics So why do most CCM artists refrain from getting too political? Many cite the Bible. Wells' allusion to obeying authorities is often attributed to a passage in Romans 13 where the Apostle Paul declares Christians ""must obey those who rule over you"" because they have been placed there by God. Wells, who is also a minister, is a biracial man who has talked about being racially profiled on social media. But he follows the 11th commandment of CCM: Stay away from politics. ""When you talk about politics, the air leaves the room,"" says the singer, whose crossover appeal is so broad he has opened for Lionel Richie. ""It just automatically goes negative when we forget that there is so much positive stuff happening as well. But we also forget that our hope as believers is not invested in an earthly kingdom, or a governmental system. It really doesn't matter as much for me who's in office because I don't serve at the pleasure of the President. I serve at the pleasure of the King [Christ]."" There is another, less ethereal reason why CCM artists stay away from politics -- loss of income. White evangelicals are Trump's most steadfast supporters. They are also some of the biggest fans of CCM, and they wield economic clout.Steady work for any musician is precarious, especially in a niche genre like Christian or gospel music. If a Christian musician wants to get a steady paycheck there's usually only one type of megachurch that has the resources to hire them as a full-time worship leader, Keen says. ""It's going to be fundamentalist, Bible-believing churches,"" he says. Then there's another factor that encourages CCM artists to toe the theological line. In the CCM world, fans call out artists who stray from traditional beliefs. Dan Haseltine, lead singer for the group Jars of Clay, was mauled on Twitter after he questioned why gays shouldn't marry in a series of posts. He later apologized for his comments, calling them a poor choice of words. Social Club Misfits, a Christian hip-hop duo that pushes the boundaries of CCM, also was attacked on social media after they released songs that called for compassion for gays and lesbians, says member Fernando Miranda, who performs under the name Fern. ""People thought we were being anti-Christian,"" he says. ""I remember the forums on Facebook -- it was so bad. I don't even look on Facebook anymore."" And if that isn't discouragement enough, CCM artists can look at the example of another group that got too political for their audience -- the Dixie Chicks. The group alienated many of their fans and was blacklisted by country music radio after criticizing President Bush in 2003 for the invasion of Iraq. ""Their main audience was country, and country shut them down,"" Keen says. ""People called it censorship at the time. It wasn't censorship. It was the audience saying we don't want to hear from you if that's what you think about our President."" Preaching about the poor and the hungry Those who say CCM artists should speak out more also cite scripture. The Bible is filled with examples of prophets who spoke truth to those in power. John the Baptist lost his head because he confronted an unjust ruler. The scripture from Romans that Wells alluded to -- that Christians must obey rulers -- is also controversial because white Christians taught it to slaves to discourage them from rebelling. And some of the 20th Century's most revered Christian leaders -- The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Dietrich Bonhoeffer -- lost their lives because they refused to obey earthly authorities. The Rev. Jim Wallis, an activist evangelical pastor, says Christian artists ""shouldn't be politicians, but they shouldn't just be entertainers."" He cites Matthew 25: 31-46, the famous parable in which Jesus said people would be judged by how they treated the poor, the hungry and the stranger.Those issues are inseparable from politics, Wallis says. ""That would be like Jesus saying I was going to talk to you today about the poor, the hungry and the stranger, but I'm not going to because that could seem political,"" he says. Wallis believes there is also another pragmatic reason for CCM artists to speak out more in the age of Trump. In his new book, ""Christ in Crisis: Why We Need to Reclaim Jesus,"" he says younger evangelicals and Christians of color are deserting evangelical churches ""in confusion and disgust"" over leaders' hypocrisy and inattention to issues of social justice. And they are not alone. For the first time, Americans who say they identify with ""no religion"" now outnumber evangelicals and Catholics, according to one widely cited survey. 'Don't go left. Don't go right. Go deeper' Some of the biggest critics of evangelicals and CCM, though, are CCM artists themselves. Christian hip-hop artist Lecrae once responded to fans who told him to stick to the gospel and stop singing divisive songs about racism by saying, ""true faith stands up for the oppressed and the broken."" Gospel star Kirk Franklin also has criticized evangelicals in the past for their support of Trump. But CCM stars don't have to tell listeners to become Democrats, Wallis says. Instead, he says, they should pin their message to the example of Jesus' life. ""Don't go left. Don't go right,"" he says. ""Go deeper."" Some CCM artists cite another example as proof that a Christian band can take on hot-button political issues and thrive: U2. It may surprise casual listeners, but some of the most stirring and thought-provoking Christian contemporary music doesn't come from the CCM genre. It comes from four men from Dublin, Ireland. U2's confessional music about Christian faith has long been filled with righteous anger inspired by current events.Bono, their frontman, sings about the cross and resurrection on the group's ""October"" album. Subsequent songs like ""40, ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"" and ""With a Shout (Jerusalem)"" could be sung in virtually any Sunday morning worship. But Bono isn't a CCM fan. He has called the music risk-averse and predictable and said he prefers another collection of inspirational music: the psalms in the Bible. He says they're filled with laughter, tears, rage and doubt. ""Why is it in Christian music, I can't find them (those emotions)?"" he said in a 2017 interview. ""This has really, really got to stop. I want to hear a song about the breakdown in your marriage, I want to hear songs of justice, I want to hear rage at injustice and I want to hear a song so good that it makes people want to do something about the subject."" Social Club Misfits, the hip-hop duo, tackle some of those topics in their music. In song lyrics and on stage they have taken on such edgy subjects as racism, pornography and drug abuse. In one song they declare, "" I have gay friends and I'm not afraid to say it... And I love 'em like Christ did."" Member Martin Lorenzo Santiago, whose stage name is Marty Mar, says there's so much racism and hatred in the world that they feel compelled to say something. ""If we don't speak out ... it's shame on us,"" he says.",1
"New York (CNN Business)Dish Network customers who had lost access to Fox (FOXA) TV programming will again be able to watch their local Fox station, Fox Soccer Plus and other channels. Fox and Dish reached a multi-year agreement, the companies confirmed Sunday. The blackout was just the latest in a history of contentious contract disputes between Fox, a content distributor with millions of loyal viewers, and Dish (DISH), the satellite provider with more than 12 million subscribers. Nearly two weeks ago, as the companies were in the midst of tense contract negotiations, Fox blocked customers of Dish and Sling TV (owned by Dish) from accessing its local channels in 17 markets. Dish also removed access to Fox's cable networks FS1, FS2, Big 10 Network, Fox Soccer Plus and Fox Deportes. Dish said on September 26 that Fox was seeking a double-digit percentage-rate increase for carrying its local channels. Dish also said Fox wanted to ""force bundle"" its local channels with its cable networks, which Dish said would hike prices for its customers. Dish offered Fox a short-term contract extension to maintain consumers' access to the channels during the negotiations, but Fox turned it down, Dish claimed. With the new deal, Dish and Sling customers will immediately regain access to the Fox channels and networks, a Fox spokesperson said. ""We are grateful to our viewers for their patience during this disruption,"" the Fox spokesperson said. The terms of the long-term carriage deal were not disclosed.",0
"(CNN)A 15-year-old male has been charged with attempted murder in the shooting of 7-year-old girl who was out trick-or-treating on Halloween, according to police. The teen is scheduled to appear in court Saturday to face two counts of attempted first-degree murder and two counts of aggravated battery in the shooting, which also left a man wounded. The girl, dressed as a bumble bee, was trick-or-treating with her family around 5:30 p.m. Thursday in the Little Village neighborhood when a group of men chasing another man began shooting, Chicago police Sgt. Rocco Alioto told reporters. The child was shot in the lower neck, police said, and is in critical condition at Stroger Hospital. A 31-year-old man also was shot in the incident. He was in stable condition Thursday night after being transported to Mount Sinai Hospital with a gunshot wound to his left hand, police said. There is no relationship between the victims, police said. The child is ""fighting for her life,"" Alioto said Thursday. ""This is unacceptable. It's a 7-year-old girl that's trick-or-treating with her family out here and happens to get shot because a group of guys want to shoot at another male while there is a street full of kids trick-or-treating,"" Alioto said. Police believe the shooting was the result of a dispute between two gangs and multiple offenders were involved, but police do not have an exact number, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said. The shooter wore a ""Jason"" mask from the ""Friday the 13th"" movie, he said. Detectives recovered a firearm that may be connected to the shooting, Chicago police chief communications officer Anthony Guglielmi said via Twitter. Johnson called the shooting ""reprehensible"" and those behind it ""cowards"" during a news conference Friday announcing historic lows in the number of homicides and shootings during October in the city. ""None of that matters if parents that live in certain communities can't even take their children out on Halloween,"" he said.",0
" (CNN)""My parents didn't want to move to Florida,"" Jerry Seinfeld used to say in his standup routines, ""but they're in their sixties, and that's the law."" The joke resonated with audiences in New York, where there has been a decades-long migration of older residents to the Sunshine State in search of warmer weather and lower taxes. Now, at 73, President Donald Trump is going too. Trump's legal change of residence from New York to Florida was reported by the New York Times Thursday. Trump's move may well reduce his tax liability but reporting on his tax returns has suggested he has been very successful at avoiding them even while living in a high-tax state. ""Trump's legal move to Florida may indeed be about taxes, as Trump himself suggests, but just not about paying taxes, which Trump doesn't do. Instead, the move seems inspired by attempts to disclose Trump's taxes, which the President also very much does not like to do,"" observed ""New York has been aggressive on the front of trying to shed light on Trump's taxes: The state legislature passed a law facilitating Congress's access to Trump's state-level returns, and the Manhattan district attorney, Cy Vance, has been pressing the case for access to Trump's returns in court."" But Florida's Republican state officials will likely take a different stance, McCaffery noted. ""In Florida, Trump can work on his tan while not worrying about any tax forms being disclosed to anyone."" Errol Louis wrote, ""We may not know Trump's precise Florida-vs-New York tax math, but the political math behind relocating is crystal clear...Trump clearly hopes to carry Florida's 29 electoral votes again to win re-election -- he kicked off his 2020 campaign with a rally in Orlando -- but he knows that it's still a true swing state, going to Republican President George Bush twice (in 2000 and 2004), then swinging back to Democratic President Barack Obama (in 2008 and 2012)."" The move has the added benefit for Trump of distance from a state and city whose politicians are particularly opposed to the President. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been a fierce critic, Rep. Jerry Nadler heads up the House Judiciary Committee, which is part of the impeachment process, and Chuck Schumer leads the Democrats in the US Senate. Impeachment game on As the House voted to officially launch an impeachment inquiry, the divide between liberal and conservative commentators last week could not have been any starker. Joe Lockhart, a Democrat who served in the White House during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, credited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with a smart strategy and suggested that upcoming public hearings on impeachment are likely to be persuasive: ""By having staff counsel lead the questioning, Democrats have a very good chance of methodically telling the story of why the President should be impeached."" By contrast, he wrote, ""The White House does not appear to have a strategy at all. The President has tweeted his way through the last few weeks looking desperate and angry, flitting from one defense to another."" He gave Pelosi and the Democrats an A, House Republicans a B minus and Trump an F on strategy. Republican Scott Jennings completely disagreed. The House will impeach and the Senate won't remove Trump, he predicted. ""There will be nothing to show for it but wasted time and a diversion of the nation's political conversation away from issues that real people care about,"" he lamented. ""Let's be honest. The Democrats were always going to do this. From the minute we realized on election night that Donald Trump had won, they began fantasizing about nullifying the election results."" All in the family Impeachment became a family affair last week. Ivanka Trump quoted a letter Thomas Jefferson wrote to his daughter in 1801 bemoaning ""enemies and spies catching and perverting"" his statements. Ivanka Trump's husband, Jared Kushner, said in an interview that he has been busy cleaning up ""messes"" left behind by former vice president Joe Biden. While Kushner's comments to an Israeli TV station likely pleased his father-in-law, wrote Michael D'Antonio, they ""also remind us that the stickiest aspect of the impeachment crisis involves Biden in a way that reflects very negatively on the Trump side."" Of course, family is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, which focuses on the allegation that President Trump withheld aid to Ukraine while pressing that nation's new president to investigate Biden's son, Hunter. (No evidence of wrongdoing has surfaced against Joe and Hunter Biden.) Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project On Government Oversight, argued that there's more than a little hypocrisy in Trump's focus on Hunter Biden. She wrote: ""It is difficult to comprehend how Hunter Biden's activity is different from the ways in which Trump's own children are enriching themselves, with the one big exception: Trump's daughter and son-in-law are simultaneously acting in a governmental capacity...Trump is an utterly absurd messenger for this issue."" Coming soon: Fractured States of America This month, CNN Opinion will publish a special project examining the American political divide and how to bridge it. John Avlon provided a preview last week, and we asked you for your thoughts. Hundreds have responded so far -- but there's still time for you to submit ideas via the reply box in Avlon's piece. He described the stakes: ""Polarization is killing our country. It is weakening our political and social bonds, separating our economic fortunes and driving bitter cultural divides... A fixation on our differences is fracturing us into warring tribes, threatening to turn our country into little more than a collection of grievance groups who believe that folks on the other side of the divide are the ones really tearing our national apart."" What would you take? If you had to suddenly abandon your house and faced the prospect of never seeing it again, what would you take with you? Matt Villano had to make that kind of choice when he was forced to evacuate to escape the Kincade fire, one of the blazes besieging California. ""Two cats, my wife's wedding dress, a case of my best brandy and some computer equipment. When it was time to leave my Sonoma County home on Saturday for what I thought could be the last time, these were the things I loaded into my car first,"" he wrote. David Perry's 10-year-old daughter saw video of the wildfires last Sunday and asked at dinner, over a bowl of fettuccine, ""California's on fire?"" ""My wife explained about the drought and the high winds, and I told our daughter that this was part of climate change making the natural world more dangerous...when I see the worry and empathy in my daughter's eyes, I know I have to do more than just allay her fears. I have to believe my own message and remember there's genuine hope -- and then get back to work pursuing that systemic change."" Alice Hill, a former special assistant to President Barack Obama, lived in fire-prone parts of California for two decades. She noted that California's improved building codes have saved some homes, but that's not enough: ""California keeps adding more homes to areas already deemed at high risk under current conditions. Just days after the Camp Fire, which was up to that time the deadliest and most destructive fire in California's history, Los Angeles County approved the construction of 19,000 houses in an area that, according to the state's own analysis, was already at 'high' or 'very high' fire risk, even without the added risk from climate change."" The end for ISIS leader On Sunday morning, President Trump made the announcement: ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had died during a raid carried out by US special forces. Trump deserved to take a ""victory lap,"" wrote Peter Bergen. ""Trump's campaign against ISIS is one of the unalloyed foreign policy successes of his presidency,"" noted Bergen, adding that Trump and former president Obama had taken many of the same approaches to targeting terrorist groups and their leaders. But ISIS is not dead, he wrote, and ""as we saw with the death of Osama bin Laden eight years ago, the ideology of jihadism is not extinguished with the death of any one leader."" Trump's victory speech, with its so-far unverified claim that Baghdadi died ""whimpering and crying and screaming all the way"" was over the top, in the view of Bill McGowan and Juliana Silva. ""As Americans, we like to think of ourselves as winners. But winners should behave accordingly. As the famous saying goes, 'When you make it to the end zone, act like you've been there before.'"" Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky warned, ""Trump's public rollout, his overt partisanship and the absence of a post-Baghdadi strategy to deal with ISIS in Syria...may well rob the administration of any lasting political and strategic gain from a well-deserved accomplishment."" Writing from Turkey, CNN's Sam Kiley zeroed in on Europe's passive role in the broader Syria story. ""They are good at dismay, the Europeans,' he wrote. ""Their cheek-clutching horror at...Trump's abandonment of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) was worthy of Munch's 'The Scream.'"" Europe's ""armed forces need to be able to function outside of an American life support system and show some initiative, rather than wailing when the White House does something surprising."" Hero and the smear Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who serves in the White House on the National Security Council staff, emerged as a key witness in the impeachment inquiry. While his decision to speak out was applauded by Democrats, Vindman was criticized by some pundits on the right, who suggested the Purple Heart-winning soldier's loyalty might be in question because of his roots in Ukraine. ""The slanderous suggestions that he's disloyal because of birthplace and because he speaks Ukrainian are plainly disgusting,"" wrote Jill Filipovic. ""And they are profoundly unpatriotic."" Retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling recalled a conversation he had with another immigrant soldier who was working in a role similar to one Vindman once had. ""She reminded me that of all the countries the US had as partners or were allied with as part of NATO, only one took an oath to defend a piece of paper...the Constitution. That's what makes us different, she said, because we don't vow to defend land or the head of state, we vow to protect and defend ideas."" ""That is what Lt. Col. Vindman is doing right now."" Zuckerberg's contradiction Twitter's CEO made Facebook's plight look even worse last week. Jack Dorsey announced that Twitter would no longer accept political advertising in the midst of a raging controversy over Facebook's decision to run political ads even if they're false. Stanley Fish wrote that Twitter's move increased the pressure on Facebook's chief, Mark Zuckerberg, who has been visibly struggling to explain the company's stance, most notably in an exchange with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Zuckerberg last week defended the policy on a call with Wall Street analysts after the company reported blockbuster revenue and traffic. ""He is pledged to two contradictory ambitions,"" Fish wrote. ""On the one hand, he doesn't want to censor anyone's speech, but on the other he doesn't want his platform to be the vehicle of evil effects."" ""The dilemma that produces Zuckerberg's comical performances is baked into the situation. Neither Facebook nor any other platform will ever be able to strike the balance Zuckerberg seeks.""",0

"(CNN)The little that is known about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is, for the most part, questionable. The year of his birth was supposedly changed to be more auspiciously aligned with that of his grandfather Kim Il Sung's, just as his father's had before him. He may or may not have three children. He may have an explosive temper, something his former girlfriend reportedly experienced during his school years in Switzerland. Keen observers have said he's sick, and suffering from gout. They've said he's isolated and in danger of being overthrown, and that there are assassination plots against him. That he's weak and spoiled and surrounded by yes-men. It won't be long, defectors claim, before he's gone. There's no sign, however, of that happening any time soon. In a startling diplomatic breakthrough, US President Donald Trump has agreed to meet with Kim -- a calculation that could be the young dictator's ultimate survival strategy. The meeting follows whirlwind diplomatic efforts by South Korea, which invited the North to participate in the Winter Olympics, easing tensions on the peninsula following a year of North Korean nuclear and missile tests and heated rhetoric and threats of military action from the US. Kim Jong Un, according to the South Korean envoy who met him, has said he's prepared to discuss giving up the country's nuclear capabilities -- a dramatic departure from his previous stance. The historic gathering will also be an opportunity to find out more about the mysterious and isolated leader. Since his ascension to the supreme leadership of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, as North Korea is officially known, Kim has wasted little time embracing his grandfather's dual-track policy of military development alongside economic growth. He attends military drills and exercises and mans artillery posts (official propaganda declares he is a military genius.) He inspects bases within view of South Korea and adopts a posture of resolute command. At the same time, he has shifted the power base away from the military and back to the ruling Worker's Party. He summoned a gathering of the party congress last year for the first time in 36 years. He pushes economic development and high-profile construction projects. And he is as focused on nuclear advancement as his forefathers were before him, arguably even more so. Yet his belligerent stance could have as much to do with facing down domestic rivals skeptical of a young heir apparent and his ability to govern the isolationist state as it has with presenting a veneer of invulnerability and strength. South Korea has its own longstanding narrative, portraying the northern regime as weak, isolated and unstable. Government sources have leaked ""credible"" information that was later proven to be false. For example, in 2015, it was widely reported that Kim executed architect Ma Won Chun because he didn't like the design of Pyongyang's new airport. Ma later appeared in state media, seemingly alive and well. All conclusions over Kim Jong Un's motives are speculative at best, and preposterously hysterical at worst. Early years In the 1990s Kim and his two siblings were sent to school in Bern, Switzerland, where they studied German and French, and mingled with other international students. The maternal aunt who looked after them later defected to the US. She and her husband spilled details to American intelligence that authorities were unlikely to obtain elsewhere about the mysterious Kim family. ""I encouraged him (Kim Jong Un) to bring his friends home because we wanted them to live a normal life. I made snacks for the kids,"" said the aunt, Ko Yong Suk, in an interview with the Washington Post. ""They ate cake and played with Legos."" Kim Jong Un was 12 years old at the time. She says they visited a Disney amusement park in Paris, swam in the French Riviera, dined in restaurants in Italy and skied the Swiss Alps. It was largely this continental education that had cheered Western observers when Kim Jong Un was named his father's successor in 2010. They'd hoped he would usher in a new era of openness with the outside world. Ko Yong Suk confirmed what many now know, that Kim Jong Un was obsessed with basketball. He played constantly. He even slept with a basketball, she said. His classmates later recalled to reporters that he had the newest Sony PlayStations complete with basketball games and the latest Air Jordan shoes. But Ko said Kim Jong Un had known since his 8th birthday party that he was destined for more important things. He was gifted a general's uniform, she said, and that at the party, real generals bowed to the eight-year-old Kim. ""It was impossible for him to grow up as a normal person when the people around him were treating him like that,"" Ko said. Ko said she and her husband decided to defect after her sister, Kim Jong Un's mother, was diagnosed with breast cancer. Once she was gone, they believed they would have no champion within the inner circle of power in Pyongyang to protect them. They moved to the US, opened a laundry business, and sent their children to American colleges. In her interview with the Washington Post, Ko spoke of the hope that they might one day be able to return to North Korea. Showing little mercy Ko and her family are unlikely to find a welcoming reception should they ever return. Since assuming the mantle of leadership, Kim Jong Un has demonstrated a ruthlessness that has spurred even more fantastical theories about his personality and what motivates him. Unlike his father, who was able to shadow Kim Il Sung for years before taking on the duties of Dear Leader, Kim Jong Un barely had a year's public tutelage upon being anointed successor, and a four-star general and vice chairman of the party's Central Military Commission, before Kim Jong Il died in December 2011. The public were still getting to know the young heir, still in his twenties, when he walked alongside the hearse carrying his father's coffin during Kim Jong Il's funeral in Pyongyang. Kim Jong Un did little to hide his emotions that day, wiping tears from his face as around him, people fell to their knees in despair. The newest Kim had to work quickly to acquaint the country with the notion of him in this new role and consolidate his rule among his late father's cohorts. Observers speculated that the Great Successor was a puppet, manipulated by veterans of the ruling class, his uncle Jang Song-taek and his wife. His father, who'd been groomed for some 20 years to replace Kim Il Sung entered a period of mourning that lasted for three years when the nation's founder passed away. By contrast Kim Jong Un made his first speech to the public a mere four months after his father's funeral. His tenure, then, began on a brutal note. A purge of dozens of senior officials. Then, the political isolation and execution of his uncle and mentor followed shortly after. In 2015 there were more purges. And there was the complicated matter of a man he purportedly never met, his half-brother Kim Jong Nam, his father's eldest son, who was passed over when Kim Jong Il came to naming a successor. Less than a month after Kim Jong Un took power, a Japanese journalist published emails he had exchanged with Kim Jong Nam -- then in exile in the Chinese controlled territory of Macau -- in which the North Korean said he was concerned over whether his half-brother would ""be able to satisfy the needs"" of the people. He insisted Kim Jong Un would be ""just a nominal figure and the members of the power elite will be the ones in actual power."" Critically, he also questioned the transfer of power to a third generation of the same ruling family, all things that are anathema to North Korea's ruling elite, whose main purpose is to maintain the strength and durability of the Kim family regime. After the emails were published in a book, Kim Jong Nam kept a low profile, under the alleged protection of the Chinese government. But on February 13, 2017, while traveling overseas, two women were caught on camera at Kuala Lumpur International Airport wiping his face with a substance that police later said was a VX nerve agent. He died on his way to hospital. North Korea has denied anything to do with his death. South Korean intelligence officials say Kim Jong Un directly ordered the killing. The two women who carried out the act against Kim Jong Nam face murder charges in Malaysian court. To observers, the killing of his half-brother demonstrated Kim Jong Un's ruthless determination to consolidate power, eliminating not only open criticism of his rule, but also the possibility of being supplanted by someone who was considered friendly to the West. Since he took office, North Korea has doubled down on its refusal to countenance criticism or attacks on its leader. To the ruling elite, lampooning Kim Jong Un was no different to mocking the Hermit Kingdom, something Sony Pictures discovered after its release of the film The Interview. The comedy depicted a journalist who was granted an interview with the North Korean ruler and is then tasked by US authorities to assassinate him. When the movie came out North Korea's National Defense Commission said President Barack Obama was ""the chief culprit who forced Sony Pictures Entertainment to indiscriminately distribute the movie"" and blackmailed movie theaters into showing the film. North Korea later claimed it had nothing to do with a massive computer hack at Sony, which downed computers, froze email and leaked scripts, internal documents and employees' salaries. His grandfather's successor Almost from the beginning Kim Jong Un has been styled to remind his people of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, the founder of the nation and a symbol of the prosperity and growth North Korea enjoyed under Soviet patronage. The uncanny resemblance Kim Jong Un bears to his grandfather has reportedly been exaggerated even further with the younger Kim modeling a similar haircut and wearing similar clothes. For many North Koreans, it is a welcome sight. Kim Jong Il's rule was almost impossible to consider without recalling the difficult days of the Great Famine, when reportedly around 3 million people died of starvation. Kim Jong Un is regularly filmed meeting people, holding their hands and giving them hugs, asking workers about their tasks and appearing actively interested in even mundane aspects of factory life, a marked contrast to Kim Jong Il who grew increasingly isolated in his later years and made fewer and fewer public speeches and appearances. The legacy Kim Jong Un carries is also beset with the expectation that he will finally achieve what both his father and grandfather had long pursued but never attained: transforming North Korea into a legitimate nuclear power. A program that was begun under Kim Il Sung and continued under Kim Jong Il, is now viewed by Kim Jong Un as the sole guarantee of his regime's longevity. Whether he can realize that ambition and what happens if he does -- remains unknown.",0
"The number of hate groups active in the USA rose to its highest level in two decades last year, according to an annual survey released Wednesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The count of active groups that the civil rights organization labels as espousing hate climbed to 1,020, up from 784 four years ago, and was propelled by a rise in extremism, the center said. From 2017 to 2018 alone, the tally rose 7 percent. The groups range from white supremacists to black nationalists, neo-Nazis to neo-Confederates. The annual tally is controversial. It gives the same hate label to some conservative church or political groups such as Catholic Family Ministries (listed as a ""general hate group"") or Conservative Republicans of Texas (branded anti-gay) as it does to outfits such as the Ku Klux Klan or American Nazi Party. The SPLC said it has been sued by three groups that say they shouldn't be considered hate groups.Heidi Beirich, director of SPLC’s Intelligence Project, told USA TODAY the groups that the center considers to be hateful enough to make the survey are reviewed carefully before being added, and ""we try to err on the side of caution."" The most significant growth was in the number of white nationalist organizations, up from 100 in 2017 to 148 in 2018, said Beirich, who wrote the report. It marks a resurgence in the aftermath of the massive rally in 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia, that focused attention on the movement. ""Much of the energy on the radical right this year was concentrated in the white supremacist milieu,"" the report says. ""After a lull that followed the violence in Charlottesville, which brought criminal charges and civil suits that temporarily dampened the radical right's activism and organizing, newer groups gathered momentum."" All are driven by concern about dwindling white power, as seen by Census Bureau projections that Caucasians will lose their majority by 2044, according to the report. After a sharp drop-off in the first half of the decade – Beirich said those groups had been driven underground – they revived as the 2016 election approached. Though the USA no longer has an African-American president, hate groups became motivated by what they saw as a delay in progress toward their goals, such as President Donald Trump being stymied in his goal of building a wall along the Mexican border, Beirich said. Last week, Trump declared a national emergency to try to build the wall without the approval of Congress. When told of the Southern Poverty Law Center's findings, an expert on hate groups said he, too, believes the problem is on the rise. ""It's depressing, but it's not surprising,"" said Jack McDevitt, director of the Institute on Race and Justice at Northeastern University. Based on recent data, he said, ""you got a whole bunch of indications we're seeing a resurgence in hate activity."" In its annual hate crime report in November, the FBI listed 7,775 criminal incidents for 2017, up from 6,121 in 2016. While many groups are adding members, the SPLC found one of the best known hate groups, the Ku Klux Klan, appears to be in decline. The group, despite a history that stretches back more than a century, has been marked by infighting and difficulty connecting to a younger generation. ""The KKK has not been able to appeal to younger racists, with its antiquated traditions, odd dress and lack of digital savvy. Younger extremists prefer ... polo shirts and khakis to Klan robes,"" the report says. But there is no shortage of hate-filled alternatives, whether they are neo-Nazis, racist skinheads or others who direct their anger at immigrants; lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender individuals; Muslims or others. Black nationalist groups, often described as anti-Semitic, hostile to lesbians, gay and transgender people and anti-white, have picked up steam. They have been driven by events such as the outcry around NFL players taking a knee during the playing of the national anthem and hot rhetoric from controversial figures such as Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan. These groups can be ""very, very fringe, and they don't produce the violence that white supremacy does,"" Beirich said. At least one of the outfits added to the SPLC list didn't seem to mind. A leader of the American Freedom Party, a New York-based group that says on its website that the ""core European American population"" is being overwhelmed by ""tens of millions of legal and illegal immigrants,"" was pleased. ""I am flattered,"" Chairman William Johnson told USA TODAY. ""It really helps elevate our reputation"" when the party is lumped with groups close to the mainstream supporting Trump and those linked to Catholicism. He said the list is so broad that it becomes meaningless. ""I don't know any organization that says I'm a hate group. I'm a love group,"" Johnson said. He said the American Freedom Party has ""nationalists of many stripes and races"" among its members, and ""white people are becoming comfortable with being proud of their heritage.""",0

In 2019, things deteriorated further when the Arkansas River flooded the city. 5. Newark, New Jersey Newark bottled water line A line outside the Bolan Street Recreation center as residents waited for cases of bottled water. Kathy Willens/AP Photo Newark has 282,000 residents, 62% are working, and 28% are living in poverty. The median commute time is over 35 minutes. Like Flint, the city has had problems with lead poisoning its water supply. The city has also struggled with race relations, which bubbled up in violent riots in 1967, and has its fair share of violent crimes, particularly in 2013. 4. Passaic, New Jersey Men gather outside a Home Depot in Passaic, New Jersey. Men gather outside a Home Depot in Passaic, New Jersey. Mark Makela / Getty Passaic has 70,000 residents — 58% of people working, and a third are living in poverty. Its youth council said the city had problems with drugs, violence, and poor sex education. 3. Detroit A man uses his cane to navigate a snow covered road in Detroit, Michigan. A man uses his cane to navigate a snow covered road in Detroit, Michigan. Joshua Lott / Reuters Detroit has 672,000 people, and from 2010 to 2018 it lost nearly 6%. While 54% of people are working, 38% live in poverty. The median household income is $27,838. The city already lost many of its residents between 1950 and 1980, when 600,000 people left after the manufacturing industry collapsed. With 43,000 abandoned homes, it's been struggling with blight and is considered one of the most dangerous cities in the United States. 2. Port Arthur, Texas The Neighborhoods around the downtown area of Port Arthur have the few views that don't include the oil facilities looming as a backdrop. The neighborhoods around the downtown area of Port Arthur have few views that don't include the oil facilities looming as a backdrop. Michael S. Williamson / The Washington Post / Getty Port Arthur, a city surrounded by oil refineries, has 55,000 residents. Fifty-three percent are working, and 30% are living in poverty. The city was hit by hurricanes in 2005, 2008, and 2017. Harvey, the latest, caused $1.3 billion in damage. Officials fear that if people keep leaving, Port Arthur will fall below 50,000 people and make it ineligible for federal grants. 1. Gary, Indiana Abandoned homes are seen in Gary, Indiana in 2011. Abandoned homes are seen in Gary, Indiana in 2011. Eric Thayer / Reuters Gary has 75,000 residents but lost 6% from 2010 to 2018. Just over half of the population works, and 36% live in poverty. The most miserable city in the US was once a manufacturing mecca, but those days are over. A drug-enforcement agent who grew up in the area told The Guardian in 2017: ""We used to be the murder capital of the US, but there is hardly anybody left to kill. We used to be the drug capital of the US, but for that you need money, and there aren't jobs or things to steal here."" When the jobs dried up, most white people left, and now 84% of people living in Gary are African American. The city is experimenting with plans to try to revitalize the area, including selling abandoned homes for $1.",0
"Not the worst, just the most miserable. We've identified the 50 most miserable cities in the US, using census data from 1,000 cities, taking into consideration population change (because if people are leaving it's usually for a good reason), the percentage of people working, median household incomes, the percentage of people without healthcare, median commute times, and the number of people living in poverty. (See the data and how we weighted it here.) Often, these cities have been devastated by natural disasters. They've had to deal with blight and with high crime rates. Economies have struggled after industry has collapsed. These cities also tend to have high rates of addiction. The state with the most miserable cities was California, with 10 in the top 50. New Jersey was second, with nine, and Florida had six. Here are the 50 most miserable cities in the US, based on US census data. 50. Lancaster, California Lancaster, a desert town, has almost 160,000 people, 51% of whom work, and 23% of whom live in poverty. It's had crime problems, both with meth addiction and neo-Nazis. But Mayor R. Rex Parris is doing what he can to kickstart the city, including looking to China for investment. 49. St Louis St. Louis has almost 303,000 people, but it lost 5% from 2010 to 2018. Sixty-five percent of people work, and one quarter are living in poverty. The city has struggled with crime and gun violence. In 2015, killings rose 33% from the year before to 159 deaths. The city has relatively relaxed gun laws, including allowing people to carry loaded guns in cars without permits. Then-Mayor Francis Slay said in early 2015 that crime was the No. 1 priority for the city. 48. Pasadena, Texas Pasadena has 153,000 people, 65% of whom are working, and one-fifth live in poverty. While the median income is $50,207, nearly 29% of people don't have health insurance. Mostly working-class, the city is based near petrochemical plants and is known for its race issues. It used to be home to the Texas headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan. Now, it's divided. In the north it's primarily made up of Latino people and to the south it's mostly white people. 47. Macon-Bibb County, Georgia Macon-Bibb County has 153,000 people, but it lost 1.7% of its population from 2010 to 2018. Fifty-six percent are working, and 26% live in poverty. One of Macon-Bibb County's biggest problems is blight. Across the city there are about 3,700 unoccupied buildings, including dilapidated homes and overgrown yards. 46. Danville, Virginia Danville has 40,000 people, but its population fell by 5.5% from 2010 to 2018. Fifty-five percent of people are working, and 21% live in poverty. It used to be one of the richest cities in the Piedmont area. But it's struggled since its tobacco and textile mills shut down. The city is fighting for a comeback, however. It's set up solar farms, and its downtown is in the midst of a rehabilitation to turn abandoned warehouses into mixed-use developments. 45. Shreveport, Louisiana Shreveport has about 189,000 people, and it lost nearly 6% of its population from 2010 to 2018. Fifty-eight percent of people work, and 26% are living in poverty. In 2015, it struggled with floods from the Red River. Its murder rate also doubled from 2015 to 2016, up to 42 murders, and the city also had an increase in other crimes, like rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. 44. Hemet, California Hemet has a population of 85,000 people, and from 2010 to 2018 it grew by 8.5%. It's struggled since the 2008 recession, however. Twenty-three percent of people live in poverty, and crime rates are high. In 2016, 623 cars were stolen, 170 robberies were reported, and the police logged 398 aggravated assaults — the most this century. 43. Mansfield, Ohio Mansfield has 46,000 residents but lost 2.7% from 2010 to 2018. Forty-eight percent of people are working, and 24% are living in poverty. It used to have lots of industrial work, with people making things like steel, machinery, and stoves, but that dried up in the 1970s and 1980s. More recently, in 2010, a GM factory closed its doors, leading to more job losses. It's also had a surge in crime, and from 2012 to 2017 violent crimes rose by 37%.42. San Bernardino, CaliforniaOf San Bernardino's 216,000 residents, 57% are employed, and 30% live in poverty. It's 60 miles east of Los Angeles and has an interesting history. It's where McDonald's began, as well as the Hells Angels motorcycle gang. Along with a tough recession, it had a steel plant and an Air Force base close down, meaning even fewer jobs.41. Compton, California 41. Compton, California 40. Montebello, California Of Montebello's 62,632 people, 60% are working, and 14% live in poverty. The average commute time is 33 minutes, and 19% of people don't have health insurance. A big issue is affordable housing. A home-ownership counselor told The New York Times in 2019 that prospects for first-time buyers weren't good and that opportunities to live there weren't growing.39. Harlingen, Texas Harlingen has 65,000 residents; 56% are working, and 30% live in poverty. It's a hot city, with little rainfall, though recently it's been dealing with flooding. It's also one of three cities where 2,000 immigrants were released in 2019, putting pressure on the city to help them. 38. Reading, Pennsylvania Reading has 88,495 residents, of whom almost 62% are working and 36% live in poverty. In 2011, The New York Times said it was the poorest city in the US. Its economy struggled after factories closed down or downsized, laying people off. An estimated 44% of households are on food stamps, among the most in the country.37. Hallandale Beach, Florida Hallandale Beach has about 40,000 people, 60% of whom are working; 20% live in poverty. More than 29% of people are without health insurance. Halfway between Miami Beach and Fort Lauderdale, it's been called a ""once scruffy beach town,"" by The Wall Street Journal. It also has plenty of strip clubs and has been nicknamed ""Hound-ale Beach."" 36. Palmdale, California Palmdale has 156,667 people — 59% are in the workforce, and 19% live in poverty. It also has a median commute time of 42.7 minutes, which is the highest on the list. It was at one point called ""the foreclosure capital of California."" 35. Anderson, Indiana Anderson has 55,000 residents but lost 2% from 2010 to 2018. Fifty-six percent of people are employed, and one-quarter live in poverty. Things deteriorated for the once thriving GM city, which had 24 factories, when the carmaker closed factories and 23,000 people lost their jobs. It's also been a city that has been dealing with blight. In 2015, the city was given $2.8 million to tear down 100 abandoned homes, and there were hundreds more that could have qualified. 34. Fort Pierce, Florida Fort Pierce has 46,000 people and grew by almost 10% from 2010 to 2018. Just over half of people there are employed, and almost 36% of people in poverty. This city used to have an economy based around citrus farming, but it struggled with diseases and the effects of trade deals. It also has to replenish the sand on its beaches every few years because of ocean erosion. 33. North Miami Beach, Florida North Miami Beach has almost 46,000 people; 65% are working, and just under 20% are living in poverty. But 32% of residents don't have healthcare, and the average commute time is 31 minutes. Another issue for living in this area could be the tumultuous politics, as two recent mayors have faced criminal charges for their spending. 32. Jackson, Mississippi Jackson has almost 165,000 residents, but from 2010 to 2018 it lost more than 5% of its population. Sixty-two percent of the population is working, and almost 29% live in poverty. In February, the city threatened to cut off water for 20,000 people because $45 million worth of bills hadn't been paid. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, elected in 2017, said his goal was to make the city the ""most radical"" on earth by taking on issues like poverty in new ways. 31. Saginaw, Michigan Saginaw has 48,000 people, and from 2010 to 2018 it lost 6% of its population. Fifty-five percent of people are working, and nearly 34% are living in poverty. Like many other cities on this list, it used to have a lot of manufacturing jobs — at one point about 25,000 with General Motors. But they didn't last. Some locals reportedly refer to the city as ""sag-nasty"" because of its issues with crime. In May 2019, violent crime had fallen in the city, with 16 shootings to date, compared with 30 at that point in 2018. 30. Plainfield, New Jersey Plainfield has 50,693 people, 70% of whom are working and one-fifth of whom live in poverty. Nearly one-third are without health insurance, and the median commute time is 31 minutes. It used to be a violent city — in 1990 there were 719 violent crimes, but since then things have improved. Still, in 2016 there were 12 murders. 29. West New York, New Jersey West New York has nearly 53,000 people, and it grew by 6.6% from 2010 to 2018. Almost 70% are working, and 22% are living in poverty. Cleanliness and parking are meant to be two of the biggest issues for its new mayor. The median commute time is 37 minutes. 28. Miami Gardens, Florida Miami Gardens has 113,000 people — 60% are working, while about 22% live in poverty. In 2014, it was called the ""stop and frisk capital of America,"" after an investigation showed nearly 57,000 people had been frisked since 2008. Another issue in the area is the cost of water. Because it comes from a plant owned by the City of North Miami Beach, the cost of living is a little bit higher. In March, the city was suing to fight the extra 25% surcharge. 27. Cleveland Cleveland, sometimes called the ""mistake by the lake,"" has 384,000 people. Its population fell 3% from 2010 to 2018. Nearly 59% of the population is working, and 35% live in poverty. An August 2019 report found that half of those living in poverty were working. The city has struggled for years since losing the bulk of its manufacturing industry. In 2010, Forbes said it was the most miserable city in the US. It also had a bad year for gun violence in 2015, with 85 gun homicides. 26. Youngstown, Ohio Youngstown has about 65,000 people, and it lost 3% of its population from 2010 to 2018. Just over half of its population is working, and nearly 37% of its people live in poverty. It used to have a population of 170,000 and was the third-biggest steel producer in the United States, until the factory began downsizing in 1977. It was also recorded as having some of the worst air pollution in Ohio in 2017. 25. North Miami, Florida North Miami has about 63,000 people, 65% of whom are working, while 23% are in poverty. One of the big issues it faces is flooding, even when it doesn't rain. Sometimes, all that's necessary for flooding is a full moon. It is also facing problems around septic tanks (the city has 2,780) that soon might not be able to operate properly because of rising sea levels. This could result in wastewater ending up in yards and other places it's not meant to be. 24. Huntington, West Virginia Huntington has 46,000 people, and it lost 6.4% of its population from 2010 to 2018. Just over half are working, and about a third live in poverty. A thriving coal town with 90,000 people in 1950, it has since fallen on harder times. In 2008, the city was described as the unhealthiest in America. The opioid crisis has led Huntington to be named America's overdose capital. But overdoses have fallen since 2017. 23. Hammond, Indiana Hammond has about 76,000 people, and its population fell by 6.2% from 2010 to 2018. Sixty-one percent of people are in the labor force, and 22% live in poverty. A 2014 study found the city was one of the most industrial in the state and as a result had problems with air and water pollution. Lead contamination has been a particular concern for residents. 22. El Monte, California El Monte has 115,000 residents; 58% of its population is working, and 22% live in poverty. The average commute time is half an hour. The city, which is located near two freeways and close to Los Angeles, had a lot of revenue coming in from car dealerships, but it struggled during the recession when three dealerships closed, and the city's tax revenue fell. It's continued to have issues with finances, and the city is now divided over the future of marijuana production, and one large facility in particular. 21. Lynwood, California Lynwood has 70,500 residents — 60% work and 23% are impoverished. It was once called ""the best place to live best."" But things didn't stay that way. The construction of Interstate 105, which cut right through the city, caused many to leave their homes and 1,000 homes and businesses to be knocked down. More recently, officials have struggled to manage the city's finances, resulting in losses that could have been used to help the city. 20. Huntsville, Texas Huntsville has 41,500 residents; 39% of its people are working, and almost 35% live in poverty. The low employment, however, is in part because those living in prisons are counted in the city's population. The Department of Criminal Justice is the city's biggest employer, providing nearly 7,000 jobs. Since 1999, Texas' executions have been done exclusively out of Huntsville. 19. Paterson, New Jersey Paterson has 145,000 residents, 57.5% of its population is working, and 29% live in poverty. It used to produce silk in the 19th century, but it's since struggled. In a cruel twist of fate, the Great Falls, which was used to power factories, ended up flooding the city after Hurricane Irene in 2011. From 2009 to 2016, the city's tax revenue fell by 38%. It's also had problems with blight. At one point it had 1,250 abandoned homes, but that dropped to 770 in 2016.18. Albany, Georgia Nicknamed ""the good life city,"" Albany has 75,000 people, though its population fell by almost 3% from 2010 to 2018. Nearly 58% of the population is working, and a third live in poverty. Along with poverty and crime, it also has been dealing with severe damage and ruined crops from a severe tornado and Hurricane Irma in the past few years. 17. Trenton, New Jersey Trenton has a population of 84,000. Almost 60% of people are working, and 27% are living in poverty. It used to be an industrial city with a catchphrase, ""Trenton makes, the world takes,"" but it has since fallen on harder times. Its violent crime isn't increasing, but neighborhood gangs have been known to fight one another, and gun violence is a problem. 16. Cicero, Illinois Cicero has 81,500 residents, but that fell by 3% from 2010 to 2018. Two-thirds of people are working, and just under 20% live in poverty. The median commute time is 31 minutes. It's known for being Al Capone's ""private playground"" back in the 1920s, and since then the city has fought the nickname and crime. In 1999, the city even voted to make gang members leave within 60 days or face a daily $500 fine.15. Union City, New JerseyUnion City has 68,500 residents, almost 70% of whom are working, while 23% live in poverty. The average commute time is 33 minutes. It's only 1.28 square miles, making it one of the most densely populated areas in the US.14. Bell Gardens, CaliforniaBell Gardens has 42,300 residents; 63% of people are working, and almost 30% are living in poverty. According to a city official in 1991, the problem with the city was too many people. The city has had to depend on a casino for much of its tax revenue — in 2002, it provided more than half.13. Hialeah, FloridaHialeah has 239,000 residents, 56% of whom are working, while almost 26% live in poverty. Nearly 31% don't have health insurance. With a primarily Hispanic population, it's one of the least diverse cities in the country. It's also been rated as the worst city in the US for having an active lifestyle.12. Brownsville, TexasBrownsville has 183,000 residents, 56% of people are working, and more than 31% of people are living in poverty. More than 35% don't have health insurance. The city is on the Mexican border and is often a crossing for immigrants who entered the country illegally, making it one of the most patrolled places in the country. According to locals, three types of helicopters fly overhead. Concern around immigration has also made it difficult for some residents to sell their properties. 11. New Brunswick, New Jersey New Brunswick has 56,000 residents, 54% of people are working, and 35% are living in poverty. It has had problems with crime. In 2017, the city's assaults with guns rose 64%.10. Huntington Park, CaliforniaHuntington Park has 58,000 residents; 63% of people are working, and 28% of people live in poverty. The median commute time is 31 minutes. The Los Angeles Times describes Huntington Park as a ""working class haven,"" which has affordable housing, but high poverty rates mean many struggle to purchase homes. The area is more than 97% Latino and has been called an ""entry point for immigrants."" A reasonable portion of those immigrants are unauthorized and can't vote, resulting in low political engagement for the area. 9. Warren, OhioWarren has 38,000 residents, and its population fell by 7.7% from 2010 to 2018. About half of people are working, and two-thirds live in poverty. It's had a slow economy for a while, but things weren't helped when General Motors announced in 2018 it would stop work in a plant nearby, meaning people had to leave the city to find work. Along with Youngstown, Warren has the second-highest rate of people struggling to find enough food in the country.8. Camden, New JerseyCamden has 74,000 residents, and its population fell by 4% from 2010 to 2018. Nearly 57% of people are in the work force, and 37% live in poverty. The average household income is $26,105 — the lowest on this list. It used to be a manufacturing city, but that fell to pieces between the 1950s and the 1970s. It's had a high crime rate and been known as one of the most dangerous cities in the country, but it is improving. In 2017, there were 22 murders, which was the lowest number since 1987, thanks in part to new police procedures. 7. Flint, Michigan Flint has 96,000 residents, and it's fallen by 6% from 2010 to 2018. Just over half of people are working, and 41% of people are living in poverty — the highest on this list. The city has struggled with a decline in manufacturing. By 1990, General Motors had downsized in the area, leaving many without jobs. Flint is perhaps best known for the water crisis it's been facing since 2014, where residents were being poisoned with lead. On top of that, it's got 20,000 abandoned properties to deal with, a consistently high murder rate, and an opioid problem. 6. Pine Bluff, Arkansas Pine Bluff has 42,000 residents, and from 2010 to 2018 it lost nearly 14% of its population — the biggest loss on this list. Fifty-two percent of people are working, and 30% are living in poverty. People left as the state lost almost 3,000 manufacturing jobs from 2016 to 2017. In 2019, things deteriorated further when the Arkansas River flooded the city. 5. Newark, New Jersey Newark has 282,000 residents, 62% are working, and 28% are living in poverty. The median commute time is over 35 minutes. Like Flint, the city has had problems with lead poisoning its water supply. The city has also struggled with race relations, which bubbled up in violent riots in 1967, and has its fair share of violent crimes, particularly in 2013. 4. Passaic, New Jersey Passaic has 70,000 residents — 58% of people working, and a third are living in poverty. Its youth council said the city had problems with drugs, violence, and poor sex education. 3. Detroit Detroit has 672,000 people, and from 2010 to 2018 it lost nearly 6%. While 54% of people are working, 38% live in poverty. The median household income is $27,838. The city already lost many of its residents between 1950 and 1980, when 600,000 people left after the manufacturing industry collapsed. With 43,000 abandoned homes, it's been struggling with blight and is considered one of the most dangerous cities in the United States. 2. Port Arthur, Texas Port Arthur, a city surrounded by oil refineries, has 55,000 residents. Fifty-three percent are working, and 30% are living in poverty. The city was hit by hurricanes in 2005, 2008, and 2017. Harvey, the latest, caused $1.3 billion in damage. Officials fear that if people keep leaving, Port Arthur will fall below 50,000 people and make it ineligible for federal grants. 1. Gary, Indiana Gary has 75,000 residents but lost 6% from 2010 to 2018. Just over half of the population works, and 36% live in poverty. The most miserable city in the US was once a manufacturing mecca, but those days are over.

"No use kidding ourselves any longer. Donald Trump’s response to the impeachment probe into his documented attempt to use U.S. foreign policy to advance his political fortunes reveals, more than anything else he’s done so far, that this president has little use for the Constitution or the traditions of American democracy. He sides with the autocrats of the world because he himself is one—or, at the very least, aspires to be. And that extends to the constitutional provisions for his removal: Based on what he has said in recent days, even if Trump is impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate, he may well reject such a verdict as illegitimate. Trump has already warned that a “civil war” might ensue. On Tuesday night he tweeted: “I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment, it is a COUP.” The U.S. constitutional crisis is, in other words, only in its beginning stages. In the weeks since the Ukraine revelations surfaced, Trump has insisted repeatedly that there was nothing wrong with his effort to strong-arm Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden, one of Trump’s leading Democratic challengers for 2020—even though Trump’s own former homeland security advisor, Tom Bossert, said he had previously informed the president that the allegations against Biden were baseless. Trump has said, again and again, that his conversation with Zelensky was “perfect.” The president has also sought to delegitimize House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for launching an impeachment inquiry into his behavior—“As far as I’m concerned, she’s no longer the speaker of the House,” he told reporters last week. And he has suggested that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, the Democrat in charge of the inquiry, should be arrested for treason. As is Trump’s wont, he can be expected to hew to, repeat, and tweet these clearly stated views endlessly in the months ahead, come what may. As with so much of what Trump says and tweets, many of these statements are so absurd that they seem clownish. But let’s be frank: They are also the views of an aspiring authoritarian ruler. In the nearly three years since Trump took office, various pundits have suggested that he is autocratic in spirit and mindset, restrained only reluctantly by the thin veneer of constitutional checks and balances. But nothing Trump has done has exposed his true point of view as much as the current crisis over Ukraine. What were once only hints of anti-democratic tendencies have become clearer in recent weeks as news surfaced of Trump’s efforts to find dirt on Biden—allegedly holding Ukraine’s military aid hostage to this effort (and including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on the call, as we’ve now learned). Trump appears to have ordered his administration—including, most recently, Pompeo—to defy congressional perquisites and subpoenas. He has insisted that he can do as he pleases and has abused any coherent interpretation of the Constitution, telling a crowd of young people in a July speech: “I have an Article II, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president.” He has sought to “lock down” ordinary presidential interactions in a secure system intended for classified information, according to the whistleblower complaint. The president has also reportedly pressured Australia and other nations to help U.S. Attorney General William Barr investigate the legitimacy of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian election interference, in an effort to cast doubt over his campaign’s dealings with Moscow. Trump has, moreover, repeatedly expressed his contempt for the democratic nations of the West and his consistent support of his fellow would-be autocrat, Russian President Vladimir Putin—whom he tried to bring back into the G-7. He has recently sought to forgive or at least minimize Putin’s military activity in eastern Ukraine, and he suggested that Ukraine, not Russia, was involved in interfering in the 2016 U.S. election, despite the firm conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community to the contrary. Trump has also lavished praise on Chinese leader Xi Jinping, congratulating him Tuesday upon the 70th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party’s rule, even as police shot a teenage protester in Hong Kong. “There are two common ways of talking about authoritarianism in politics,” said Jonathan Weiler of the University of North Carolina, a co-author of the 2009 book Authoritarianism and Polarization in American Politics. “One is as a regime type, a non-democratic system characterized by a concentration of power in largely unaccountable leaders. The second is as a personality type, characterized by a psychological need for order and a related tendency to want to exclude ‘outgroups’ from political power in order to preserve an often sentimentalized version of a halcyon past.” Trump, Weiler said, is the latter sort—the personality type that rises up in troubled democratic polities and then, bit by bit, seeks to destroy those traditions, displacing them with a personal power grab. It has been the approach of the most successful authoritarian leaders of the past who have risen to power in nominally democratic systems. Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini infamously kicked apart broken parliamentary systems to seize power. Mao Zedong dismantled the tenuous democracy of post-imperial China. Trump has brilliantly exploited the almost Weimar-like paralysis in Washington—a Congress all but unable to act on major issues for years now—to lay bare the fusty dysfunction that with a strong enough push, could possibly be swept away. Given American democracy’s long-entrenched traditions, Trump will have a hard time destroying it, but that doesn’t mean he can’t. “Authoritarian leaders like Putin and Xi, whatever their personality traits, derive their power from the political system they’ve come to take the helm of,” Weiler said. They don’t have to work very hard to eliminate the meager yearnings for democracy that might exist in their nations—as Putin showed when he crushed the brief, weak, and corrupt post-Soviet democracy left behind by Boris Yeltsin. But Trump has been very effective at exploiting the emerging weaknesses in American democracy—including its chronic polarization and increasing reliance on internet-fed rumors for information—and intimidating anyone who tries to impose checks on his authority. “He’s single-minded, it would seem, in his desire to attack, demean and punish anyone who would try to challenge his power or hold him accountable. All of which makes for a volatile, unstable and dangerous situation,” Weiler said. Trump has plainly tried to embrace the traditions of authoritarianism, though he has been, until now, far more constrained by American laws and traditions than his fellow would-be autocrats around the world. Like Xi and Putin, he has built a personality cult around himself with a political base that is itself dominated by so-called authoritarian personalities—people who are inspired by xenophobia, adoration of the leader, and contempt for democratic institutions. “Trump’s electoral strength—and his staying power—have been buoyed, above all, by Americans with authoritarian inclinations,” the University of Massachusetts political scientist Matthew MacWilliams wrote before Trump’s election. And many supporters insist they will never desert Trump, who, like Xi and Putin, has suggested time and again that the interests of the nation are the same as his own personal interests, and that his hold on power is inextricably linked to the nation’s future. (Recall that in accepting the Republican nomination in 2016, Trump declared of the nation’s broken politics: “I alone can fix it.” ) According to another scholarly expert on authoritarian thinking, Robert Altemeyer of the University of Manitoba, Trump even out-authoritarians some authoritarians: “It’s hard to think of an authoritarian leader who did not equate himself with the state, so yes, that appears to be a common behavior,” Altemeyer said. “They do not always develop personality cults.” But Trump, Altemeyer said, began developing one early in his career. Above all, autocrats succeed when democrats falter, squabble, and dither. There are no Bolsheviks without Mensheviks. There are no Hitlers without Paul von Hindenburgs and Franz von Papens. There can be no Trump without a lot of scared Republicans bullied into silence. After the resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1974, when most of the Republican Party deserted Nixon in the face of evidence of obstruction of justice, his successor, Gerald Ford, said the process showed that the United States is “a government of laws and not men.” Today, almost no one in the Republican Party has given us confidence that this is still true. Trump instead has humiliated the party of Lincoln, making it his personal cheering section. In recent days, a mere handful of Republican lawmakers have allowed that his behavior toward Ukraine—an obvious abuse of presidential power—was bothersome at all. Sentiments could still change, of course. Polls show rising support for impeachment—and in the end, even Republicans will react to polls. But the question remains unanswered: If Trump is convicted in the end and refuses to leave office, who exactly will remove him?",1
"Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., suggested on Friday that President Trump's conduct had brought the country to a point where it no longer had ""values."" Cohen argued on CNN that Trump was a ""lawless president who has done everything he can to keep the public's minds away from his involvements with Russia, his ... trying to change foreign policy for his own political good, and destroying our reputation around the world, where the rule of law and democracy is what people respect America for and now, we're not doing it."" He added that America's values previously included condemning ""political prosecutions"" in other countries but ""America no longer has values. We only have interests, and foreign policy is supposed to be a combination thereof."" Cohen's comments came as House Democrats pursue an impeachment inquiry related to Trump's request that Ukraine's government investigate corruption allegations surrounding former Vice President Joe Biden. Cohen sits on the House Judiciary Committee, which has spearheaded many of Congress' efforts to investigate the president. He previously drew attention for eating fried chicken in an attempt to mock Attorney General William Barr for refusing to show up for a committee hearing. During his Friday interview, Cohen said that he was ready to impeach the president and claimed Trump engaged in a ""black and white violation of the Constitution."" ""The American public needs to understand we're not dealing with a gray area here,"" he said. Republicans have attempted to discredit the impeachment inquiry, blasting it as a partisan show and criticizing restrictions on their party's powers in the process. Trump has also denied any wrongdoing and claimed his request was a legitimate exercise of his presidential authority. ",1
"Several national sandwich chains are offering deals and freebies to bring in customers on National Sandwich Day -- but Chick-fil-A won’t be one of them. The question is: Does the company know that? The Atlanta-based company seemingly forgot when it sent out an email to loyalty program members this week gearing up for the made-up holiday held on Nov. 3, according to USA Today. ""Calling all sandwich lovers,"" the email reads in part. ""Some prefer it grilled, others fancy the original. No matter which Chick-fil-A sandwich you love, order yours on Nov. 3 for National Sandwich Day."" Problem is, Nov. 3 is a Sunday, the one day each week that Chick-fil-A restaurants are closed. Days later, the chain followed up with an email poking fun at itself in owning up to the mishap, the outlet reported. The subject of the email: ""Well ... this is awkward."" ""We recently sent an email that included a message about National Sandwich Day, which naturally we were very excited about,"" the email read in part. ""We didn’t realize it falls on Sunday, when we are closed. We apologize for the confusion and hope to see you soon (Monday-Saturday)."" Chick-fil-A did not immediately respond to FOX Business' request for comment. In 1946, founder Truett Cathy made the decision to close the chain on Sundays so that ""he and his employees could set aside one day to rest and worship if they choose"" -- a practice which is still maintained today. Chick-fil-A's e-mail gaffe comes around the same time that rival Popeyes reminded fans that its highly-regarded chicken sandwich, unavailable for months, is ""officially BACK nationwide on Sunday, Nov. 3."" The chain sold out of the sandwiches about two weeks after launching them in August, an addition that rattled the hierarchy of the existing market and left even more people beefing over chicken on social media.",0
"Why do Neo-Nazis and white supremacists keep laying claim to some of America's most popular brands? Most recently, the far-right website the Daily Stormer decided to name Papa John's the ""official pizza"" of the alt-right. The endorsement was soon disavowed by the company, which claimed it doesn't want neo-Nazis eating its pizza. But by endorsing brands the neo-Nazis succeed in giving the impression that they have mainstream allies who share their vision of an all-white world, experts say. ""The endorsements create some legitimacy for because it ties them to brands that are popular with people,"" Devin Burghart, a researcher at the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights who specializes in the alt-right, told Newsweek. ""And it's also a way to create distinctions between the alt-right and the so-called 'normies.'"" All of the claims have been made by one man: Andrew Anglin, a writer for the racist website, the Daily Stormer. Here's a list of the brands neo-Nazis say they love: Papa John's The Daily Stormer laid claim to Papa John's last week after the pizza's CEO John Schnatter blamed his company's recent financial losses on NFL players protesting police brutality during the national anthem. Papa John's is the official sponsor of the NFL, and Schnatter was recorded saying that the football league needed to get the protests under control. He was soon attacked for racism, and critics also discovered that he had vocally opposed the Affordable Care Act, known popularly as Obamacare, and donated money to the Trump campaign. This confluence of criticism from liberals gave the alt-right the opening it needed to proclaim Papa John's one of their own. The Daily Stormer posted a picture of a pizza with a swastika fashioned from pepperoni slices. The caption reads, ""Papa John: Official pizza of the alt-right?"" Papa John's soon released a statement saying it wants nothing to do with Nazis. New Balance Right after Donald Trump was elected President, the neo-Nazis also declared New Balance the ""Official Shoes of White People."" New Balance is the only shoe company that still manufactures its product in the United States. For that reason, the company's representatives were pleased that President Trump planned to scrap trade deals with Asia that could have affected local shoe markets. ""The Obama administration turned a deaf ear to us and frankly, with President-elect Trump, we feel things are going to move in the right direction,"" Matthew LeBretton, New Balance's vice president of public affairs, told the Wall Street Journal. Neo-Nazis were ecstatic, twisting the company's statement for their own purposes. ""New Balance is making a gesture to support White people and to support US manufacturing,"" Anglin wrote at the time. ""We need to support that."" The company quickly put out a statement ensuring its customers that it is a ""values-driven"" organization that believes in ""humanity, integrity, community and mutual respect for people around the world."" Taylor Swift Neo-Nazis have a strange obsession with Taylor Swift and her ""brand."" The leggy blonde singer is worshipped as an ""Aryan goddess"" by white supremacists around the Internet. Anglin said he believes Swift is secretly waiting for Donald Trump to take over the world and make racism great again. ""Firstly, Taylor Swift is a pure Aryan goddess, like something out of classical Greek poetry. Athena reborn. That's the most important thing,"" Anglin told Broadly in an interview. ""It is also an established fact that Taylor Swift is secretly a Nazi and is simply waiting for the time when Donald Trump makes it safe for her to come out and announce her Aryan agenda to the world. Probably, she will be betrothed to Trump's son, and they will be crowned American royalty,"" he continued. Swift has not denounced her alleged loyalties to neo-Nazis. In fact, four days ago she said she's suing a blogger who called on her to condemn the white supremacists who have made her their icon. Wendy's Earlier this year, the Daily Stormer also declared Wendy's the ""official burger of the Neo-Nazi Alt-Right movement"" after a representative of the fast-food chain posted a picture of the alt-right meme Pepe the Frog on the company's Twitter account. Anglin didn't waste any time. ""Wendy's was always my personal favorite burger joint, but I never would have declared it the official burger of the Neo-Nazi Alt-Right movement – until now,"" he wrote on the Daily Stormer. ""Everyone knows that Pepe is a Nazi frog."" Wendy's quickly took down the meme and released a tweet with a short explanation. ""Our community manager was unaware of the recent evolution of the Pepe meme's meaning and this tweet was promptly deleted,"" the Tweet read.",0
"(CNN)""Get over it."" So advised White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney Thursday. The staggering thing was exactly what he was admonishing folks to get over -- get over the quid pro quo that, Mulvaney admitted, President Donald Trump had engaged in with Ukraine, withholding military aid until the Ukrainian president agreed to probe a debunked tale about 2016 election interference. ""There's going to be political influence in foreign policy,"" he said on live TV. ""Get over it."" After a press briefing whose first bombshell was that President Donald Trump will hold next year's G7 summit at his own financially troubled property (Trump National in Doral, Florida), almost no one took Mulvaney's advice. So few opted to get over it, in fact—including Republicans and a reportedly rattled President-- that hours later Mulvaney denied ever saying those words. He went from what Paul Begala called the President's ""yes-man"" into a ""hey, I didn't really mean it""-man. A real chief of staff, Begala argued, is someone who doesn't hesitate to say ""no sir"" to the commander in chief: ""Those words never seem to emerge from Mr. Mulvaney's mouth,"" wrote Begala. ""Far from being a public servant, the acting chief of staff revealed himself to be a throne-sniffer of the worst order. If he were any more of a toady, he'd be catching flies with his tongue."" And after significant backlash, Trump reversed course Saturday to say the G7 won't be held at Doral after all. Mulvaney's floundering capped a week of new impeachment-inquiry intrigue, after Fiona Hill, who used to direct Russian and European affairs for the National Security Council, testified that Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his possible 2020 rival Joe Biden, and his son Hunter Biden. In Michael D'Antonio's assessment, ""the testimony of Fiona Hill -- and the role of national security adviser John Bolton -- may eventually become inciting incidents in a narrative that could rival Watergate as a political tragedy caused by a single man's self-delusion."" Throw in the tough testimony from current and former administration officials facing House questioning (and those who have already testified), Samantha Vinograd pointed out, and ""this may be the tip of the iceberg.""",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers, encouraged by President Donald Trump to get tougher in fighting Democrats’ attempts to impeach him, on Wednesday disrupted the U.S. House of Representatives impeachment inquiry and prevented a Pentagon official from testifying.The Republicans stormed into a hearing room where Laura Cooper, the U.S. defense official who oversees Ukraine and Russia matters, was due to testify behind closed doors and began yelling, lawmakers and aides said. The impeachment inquiry focuses on Trump’s request for Ukraine to investigate a domestic rival - Democrat Joe Biden - for his personal political benefit. In a dramatic confrontation during an escalating probe that threatens Trump’s presidency even as he seeks re-election next year, Capitol police were called in to clear the room and bring order, a Republican congressional aide said. A witness inside the room said the Republicans brought cellphones into the high-security facility where electronic devices are forbidden. “They’re freaked out. They’re trying to stop this investigation,” Democratic Representative Ted Lieu said. “They don’t want to hear from witness Cooper today. They know more facts are going to be delivered which are absolutely damning to the president of the United States.” Republican Representative Mark Meadows told reporters of the situation in the hearing room: “There’s about 20 members (lawmakers) down there, at least a dozen that are not on the three committees. And they’re going to wait until there’s a more open and transparent process.” Republicans have called the rules for the impeachment inquiry set by the leaders of the Democratic-led House unfair. The U.S. Constitution gives the House wide latitude in how to conduct the impeachment process and set rules for the inquiry. The witness who saw the events said the Republican lawmakers pushed past Capitol Police personnel and started yelling, voicing their objections to decisions made by the Democratic leaders of the House to hold depositions in closed sessions and not release transcripts of the testimony. Republican Representative Matt Gaetz, an outspoken Trump supporter who led Wednesday’s action, had tried to enter the committee room last week but was turned away because he was not a member of any of the three committees leading the investigation. Democratic Representative Stephen Lynch, who is allowed to attend depositions as a member of House Oversight Committee, said Cooper did not testify. A House aide said the day’s impeachment-related proceedings were suspended for the time being. Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell told reporters that the Republicans had compromised a secure area of the Capitol, obstructing the impeachment inquiry and sought to intimidate a witness, but would not delay the impeachment probe overall. “We see this a an effort not only to intimidate this witness but also to intimidate future witnesses from coming forward. It’s not going to work,” Swalwell added. “We’re not going to be deterred,” Swalwell added. Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, earlier in the day arrived for testimony and was expected to face questions about Trump’s decision this year to withhold $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine approved by Congress. In testimony to the inquiry on Tuesday, William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, said Trump had made the aid contingent on Ukraine announcing it would conduct politically motivated investigations the president demanded. ‘NEVER ENDS’ Trump on Monday told reporters that “Republicans have to get tougher and fight” the impeachment, saying the Democrats “vicious and they stick together.” “It never ends. The Do Nothing Dems are terrible!” Trump wrote on Twitter earlier on Wednesday, later adding their “case is DEAD!” Before the hearing room was stormed, dozens of House Republicans appeared before reporters with some denouncing the impeachment process run by Democrats as a “joke,” a “railroad job,” a “charade” and “Soviet-style.” They complained that testimony was being taken privately rather than in public hearings and that the House did not hold a vote formally authorizing the investigation. “It is a sham, and it’s time for it to end,” Republican congressman Mark Walker said. The inquiry could lead to the House passing formal charges known as articles of impeachment, prompting a trial in the Republican-controlled Senate on whether to remove Trump from office. Senate Republicans have shown little appetite for removing Trump. As she arrived at the U.S. Capitol, Cooper did not answer questions from reporters. She apparently appeared voluntarily before the lawmakers as the Pentagon had not blocked her from testifying. The Trump administration had sought to block testimony by several other current and former officials. Taylor testified that he was told by the U.S. envoy to the European Union, that Trump had linked the aid’s release to public declarations by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that he would investigate Biden, his son Hunter Biden’s tenure on the board of a Ukrainian energy company called Burisma, and a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine, and not Russia, meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The impeachment inquiry, triggered by a whistleblower complaint against Trump by a person within the U.S. intelligence community, focuses on a July 25 telephone call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy to carry out those two investigations. Zelenskiy agreed during the call. The aid was later provided. Federal election law prohibits candidates from accepting foreign help in an election. So far, few of Trump’s fellow conservatives have appeared inclined toward his removal, though there have been some cracks in their support. Senator John Thune, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, told reporters that the picture painted by Taylor’s testimony “based on the reporting that we’ve seen is not a good one.” ",1
"As the White House struggles to build an anti-impeachment strategy, President Donald Trump turned this week to Lindsey Graham, his staunchest ally in the Senate, to try to stiffen Republican spines in that chamber. It’s not going the way the president must have hoped. On Thursday, Graham announced that he’d put forward a resolution condemning the House impeachment inquiry. By mid-afternoon, when he actually announced it, the resolution had been watered down to a plea for a different and more transparent process, apparently a sop to GOP senators unwilling to go quite that far. And yet by Friday morning, only 44 of 53 Republicans in the Senate had signed on to the resolution. A gesture meant to be a show of solidarity by senators has instead become a sign of the weakness of the president’s position. The Senate was supposed to be Trump’s firewall in the Ukraine scandal, and there’s still not any reason to believe that there would be 67 senators willing to vote to remove the president. But with impeachment in the House an all-but-foregone conclusion, as I wrote earlier this week, the administration is turning its focus to the Senate, and it’s proving to be less of a redoubt than Trump wanted. The New York Times reports: After another private meeting Monday night with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, Mr. Trump began complaining privately that he did not think Senate Republicans were doing enough to have his back. For days, some allies of the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., had agitated on Twitter for Mr. Graham to do more to try to counteract Democrats in the House. One line of pressure has been for Graham, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, to call witnesses in that chamber as a sort of counterprogramming, though on Thursday he said that made no sense to him. But Graham is not the problem; he’s signaled a willingness to stand by Trump through thick, thin, and horrific lynching analogies. The White House’s challenge is other senators. Some Republicans have been notably open to an impeachment inquiry, but most have been conspicuously quiet. Some use the time-honored excuse that they’d serve as jurors in a trial and therefore ought not to weigh in; many more are simply dodging questions. What they’re mostly not doing is mounting substantive defenses of the president’s behavior. A Daily Caller canvass found only seven of the 53 Republicans were willing to rule out voting to remove Trump. Republican senators have always been less tractable for Trump than representatives, though the GOP controls the Senate but not the House. The president has many rah-rah fans in the House, and House members are also more vulnerable to pressure from Trump-loving constituents if they get out of line with the White House. (Francis Rooney of Florida, the most outspoken Trump critic on the Ukraine matter in recent weeks, has announced he’s retiring.) Senators are more insulated from immediate political pressure, more rooted in Washington and the party structure, and less fond of the president. Nonetheless, it would take a major change in the evidence against Trump, or a vast shift in polling, for enough Republican senators to support conviction that the president would be in serious danger of removal in a Senate trial. Yet it’s clear that Trump does care a great deal about senators’ positions. The impetus for his hasty cancellation of plans to host the Group of Seven summit at this resort in Doral, Florida, was apparently the anger it provoked among Republican senators. In the past, Trump has been content to weather their displeasure, but this time he folded. Perhaps Trump believes that a unified GOP Senate response will persuade Democrats not to vote to impeach; I am skeptical that will work. Or perhaps Trump worries about the political damage if a majority of the Senate voted to convict, even if it didn’t lead to removal. It would take only four GOP defections to reach a majority for conviction in the Senate. There’s little precedent that can help forecast what the political fallout might be. A majority of senators voted to convict President Andrew Johnson, but they fell one vote short of removal; Johnson’s presidency never recovered. More recently, the Senate voted 45–50 and 50–50 to acquit President Bill Clinton, without a majority for conviction in either case. Even so, that result was arguably ruinous for his Democratic Party in the 2000 election. It would be a powerful talking point if Democrats headed into the 2020 campaign season with a vote for conviction in the Senate that had garnered a majority with Republican support, even without removal, so Trump’s worry is rational. Graham may eventually be able to cajole the rest of the Republican caucus into signing on to his resolution condemning the House process. The final vote isn’t the point, though. Graham’s resolution was intended to send a message about Senate support for Trump—and it already has. ",1
"In the midst of a historic presidential impeachment inquiry, the best place to escape from talk of the Trump administration appears to be the White House. The twice annual White House garden tours are being held this weekend in Washington, DC. These may be among the most peaceful gatherings in a politically embattled land, occasions when the only dispute is over whose peppers are better—yours or the president’s? Hundreds of local and global visitors lined up around the block as the sun was rising on a chilly Saturday morning (Oct. 19) to see the presidential grounds. Strangers exchanged pleasantries during their hours-long waits in various lines, and nary a political murmur was heard. Visitors much preferred to opine on trees and flowers than affairs of the day. I know because I, rudely it now seems, made inquiries about political leanings and was gently rebuffed. For example, Carolyn from Maryland happily shared her appreciation of the grounds on her second such tour in two years, but she was hesitant to give her last name or discuss ideology, inching away as she said on behalf of her companions, “We support the president.” This approach appeared to be nearly universal among the garden tourists. John Barnes of Arizona, who brought his 14-year-old grandson from Ohio on the tour, professed to be apolitical and was more keen to discuss the executive lawn than the president or his activities. Ivy Craig from Virginia said she didn’t support Trump but wouldn’t elaborate, although she was opinionated about expecting to see more flowers and vegetables at the tour’s end. Some dressed up for the occasion, donning heels and dresses or blazers, while others took the guidance it was a walking tour more literally, prepared in their raincoats, jeans, and sneakers. But all seemed to approach the stroll on the executive lawn with a certain reverence. For it is not every day that we, the people, are greeted by a jazz band and smiling secret service staff while meandering the sunlit walkways admiring the president’s view. Walk this way 🌳 The White House grounds are the oldest continually maintained landscape in the US. They are spacious, strategically sloped, and tactically shaded. Elegant, but not overwhelming. Presidents and first ladies have since 1870 planted commemorative trees along these paths—for example, Melania Trump’s 2018 pin oak, Jimmy Carter’s 1978 cedar of Lebanon, and John F. Kennedy’s 1962 magnolia saucer—making their literal mark on the storied terrain. “Their variations in species and generation represent the historical flow of the president’s house,” a brochure issued for the tour explains. “The White House gardens are constantly growing and adapting, just like the seat of government they encompass.” Still, visitors who were hoping for glorious bouquets and stunning floral displays were disappointed. Fleeting blooms were few and far between. “Look how small it is,” one woman murmured to her companion as she checked out the Rose Garden, where so many presidential ceremonies take place. “It seems much bigger on TV.” Nonetheless, she posed for a photo by a bush, behind which peeked fading fuchsia roses, their petals wilted and browning in the fall sunlight. And those in search of color found ample supply looking skyward to treetops ablaze in autumn’s rust and orange leaves. Down the path at the White House kitchen garden—started by Michelle Obama in 2009 “in the hope of growing a healthier nation for our children”—visitors’ competitive streak started to emerge. None seemed to note the inspirational quote by Thomas Jefferson planted among the cabbage and kale, stating, “The failure of one thing repaired by the success of another; and instead of one harvest, a continued one throughout the year.” Nor did they appear particularly impressed with the abundance of the plot. Instead, the gardeners focused on perceived shortcomings in the presidential crops. Few can claim to have a lawn as prettily manicured as the executive’s, sure. But anyone can grow oregano. Comparisons were perhaps inevitable. “Our cabbage is better than theirs,” one garden tourist and gardener noted gleefully as she inspected the neat rows of lettuce, turnips, chard, herbs, and more growing in the flourishing executive plot. Her companion pointed at a box full of bright, red vegetables and countered, sounding disappointed, “The president’s peppers are definitely doing better than ours, though.”",1
"Talk about awkward timing. Hours before President Trump announced the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the chairwoman of the Arizona Democratic Party said publicly that Trump had aligned himself with the terrorist organization. Naturally, the Arizona Republican Party called out chairwoman Felecia Rotellini for the ill-timed remark she'd made at a “We the Voters” conference on Saturday in Phoenix.Rotellini was explaining why she thought Democrats were going to show up to vote in 2020. ""Another reason why people are going to vote (is) because Donald Trump is manipulating the White House and has aligned himself with ISIS and Saudi Arabia,"" Rotellini said. State Republican Chairwoman Kelly Ward immediately fired back. ""I have to say that is not true. That is not true,"" Ward said as Rotellini tried to continue. In a major foreign policy win for the Trump administration, U.S. special forces raided an Islamic State (ISIS) compound in northern Syria; Baghdadi ultimately killed himself by setting off a suicide vest. Overall, U.S. forces killed six ISIS members. “It was a poor choice of words,” Matt Grodksy, spokesman for the Arizona Democratic Party, told The Arizona Republic. Nevertheless, he said the comments had stemmed from “President Trump's haphazard decision to withdraw troops from Syria, which has been opposed by Republicans and Democrats alike because it abandoned our Kurdish allies in the fight against ISIS, empowered Iran, Russia and the Syrian regime, and hurt our interests in the region.” Ward said Rotellini’s comments were “wildly irresponsible.” ""It is extremely disconcerting to hear the top Democrat in Arizona slander and malign an innocent person for being aligned with the world’s most evil terrorists, let alone the president of the United States,” she said, according to the newspaper. “While fear-mongering from the left is expected up to a point, we have to draw the line somewhere if they’re going to refuse to police themselves. Baseless statements like those made by the chair of the Arizona (Democratic Party) are wildly irresponsible and not rooted in reality."" Democrats and Republicans had been leery of Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, opening the door for a Turkish incursion targeting the Kurds, U.S. allies in efforts to contain the terror group. Some worried that it might allow ISIS to re-establish a stronghold in the region. The death of not only Baghdadi but also Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, a possible successor to Baghdadi, in a separate operation led by U.S. forces has helped ease some of those fears.",0

Hill's attorneys also vehemently denied allegations made in a DailyMail story that one of the nude photos shows a “Nazi-era Iron Cross” tattoo. Gosar drew some attention to his Twitter account on Wednesday with a series of tweets he wrote in reaction to the ongoing testimony of U.S. diplomat Bill Taylor and State Department official George Kent as the first witnesses in a public impeachment hearing of President Trump, sharing videos and articles that memorialized the event. ""Evidence of a link between foreign aid and political investigations simply does not exist. The longer this circus continues the clearer it becomes that @realDonaldTrump has done absolutely nothing wrong,"" Gosar wrote on his official Twitter account. Before that, ""President @realDonaldTrump voluntarily chose to release the transcript of his phone call which clearly shows he did nothing wrong. This impeachment circus is a total sham, and Adam Schiff is the clown at the center of it all."" And, before that, ""Schiff’s star witness is crumbling under pressure. He wasn’t listening to the phone call and he has never even met President Trump."" REP. PAUL GOSAR SENDS CRYPTIC TWEETS THAT READ 'EPSTEIN DIDN'T KILL HIMSELF' DURING IMPEACHMENT HEARING However, the Daily Wire and others took notice that as readers scrolled down Gosar's profile, the first letters of each tweet spelled, ""Epstein didn't kill himself."" The ""Epstein didn't kill himself"" meme has spread like wildfire after the death of convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The New York City medical examiner determined he had taken his own life, but vocal skeptics have suggested otherwise during random blurt-outs on television and other signs. In a statement to Fox News, Gosar stressed that his tweets were all ""substantive"" but appeared to have some more fun in the process. ""All of the tweets pertained to testimony from today’s hearing. Rest assured, they are substantive. Every one of them. All of them. 5 were brilliant. 1 was ok.” In other words, ""Area 51."" Hill resigned from Congress earlier this month after she was accused of having multiple inappropriate relationships with subordinates, including a congressional staffer that prompted an investigation from the House Ethics Committee.",1
"Rudy Giuliani, the personal attorney to President Donald Trump, on Tuesday penned an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal arguing why his client should not be impeached. But one line, in particular, garnered attention on Twitter. And not for the reason that Giuliani might have hoped. Giuliani, in the piece titled “The Case for the Impeachment Defense,” attempted to defend Trump by noting how the president spent only a fraction of his July phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky (which sparked the impeachment inquiry) asking him to investigate potential 2020 rival Joe Biden allegedly in exchange for withheld military aid. “The focus was on Ukrainian corruption broadly speaking and out of a five-page transcript Mr. Trump spent only six lines on Joe Biden,” Giuliani wrote on the eve of the public impeachment hearings. Critics ridiculed Giuliani over the defense:",0
"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on Roger Stone’s conviction on witness tampering and other charges (all times local): 12:30 p.m. President Donald Trump is reacting to news that his longtime friend and confidant Roger Stone was convicted of lying to Congress and witness tampering. The president tweeted Friday, just minutes after the jury handed down its verdict in federal court in Washington. He called Stone’s conviction “a double standard like never seen before in the history of our Country,” because his frequent nemeses, including Hillary Clinton, former FBI Director James Comey and “including even Mueller himself,” have not been convicted. “Didn’t they lie?,” Trump’s tweet said. Stone was convicted on a seven-count indictment brought as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election tampering. Prosecutors alleged he lied to lawmakers about WikiLeaks, tampered with witnesses and obstructed a House intelligence committee probe. __ 12:05 p.m. A judge says can Roger Stone can remain free pending his sentencing in February. Judge Amy Berman Jackson rejected prosecutors’ request that Stone be jailed following his conviction Friday for lying to Congress and other charges stemming from the special counsel’s Russia investigation. Jackson said Stone will be subject to the same conditions he faced following his arrest, including a gag order preventing him from talking to media. She set Stone’s sentencing for Feb. 6. Stone, 67, could face up to 20 years in prison. __ 11:52 a.m. Roger Stone, a longtime friend and ally of President Donald Trump, has been found guilty at his trial in federal court in Washington. Stone was convicted Friday. He was charged in a seven-count indictment that alleged he lied to lawmakers about WikiLeaks, tampered with witnesses and obstructed a House intelligence committee probe. His trial highlighted how Trump campaign associates were eager to gather information about emails hacked emails damaging to Hillary Clinton that were released by the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.Prosecutors say Stone lied to Congress about his conversations about WikiLeaks with New York radio host Randy Credico and conservative writer and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi. He’s also accused of trying to intimidate Credico and threatening to take his dog. Stone had denied the allegations and decried the case as politically motivated.",0
"President Donald Trump fired off a tweet Sunday attacking another witness in the impeachment inquiry being conducted against him, dismissing an aide to Vice President Mike Pence as a ""Never Trumper."" On Saturday, congressional investigators released the transcript from the closed-door deposition of Jennifer Williams, a foreign policy adviser to Pence who took notes during a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The call is a key aspect in the whistleblower complaint that alleged Trump was withholding military aid to Ukraine for political benefit. In her testimony, Williams said the call ""struck me as unusual and inappropriate."" ""Tell Jennifer Williams, whoever that is, to read BOTH transcripts of the presidential calls, & see the just released ststement from Ukraine,"" Trump tweeted on Sunday. ""Then she should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don’t know & mostly never even heard of, & work out a better presidential attack!"" When asked for comment on Trump's tweet, Pence press secretary Katie Waldman told CNN, ""Jennifer is a State Department employee."" Trump has insisted that a rough transcript of the call shows he did nothing wrong. But Democrats say it demonstrates that Trump wanted a ""favor"" in the form of investigations in exchange for military assistance. The president and his supporters have dismissed the impeachment inquiry as a politically motivated ""hoax."" And they have implied political bias motivated several of the career government officials who worked in the White House and have testified in the inquiry. Trump also accused the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Willam Taylor, of being a ""Never Trumper."" And on Thursday, the president sparked an uproar when he tweeted criticisms of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S, ambassador to Ukraine, as she testified before the House Intelligence Committee. ",0

"Donald Trump's right-hand man asked White House officials if there were legal grounds to withhold military aid from Ukraine in the month after the president had made the decision - according to an internal investigation uncovered by US media. The withholding of $391m of aid - and whether the move was used to pressure Ukrainian officials into launching an investigation into Mr Trump's political rival Joe Biden - has become the centrepiece of the impeachment investigation against the president. Now an internal investigation by the White House's legal department has reportedly uncovered hundreds of documents that reveal the extent of the Trump administration's attempts to justify the delay of the financial support. Among them, according toThe Washington Post, is an August email between Donald Trump's chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that shows him asking the department if there was a legal justification for the aid to be withheld. The conversation came after the president’s now-infamous 25 July call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky - during which Mr Trump said he would like Kiev to “do us a favour” regarding an investigation into Mr Biden and his son, Hunter. As well as spurring on the impeachment investigation led by house democrats, the call formed the basis of the internal White House investigation when it was revealed a transcript of the exchange was stored in a classified vault usually reserved for state secrets relating to national security. It is unclear if any of the details uncovered by the review will pose legal issues for Mr Trump - however White House lawyers were reportedly concerned that their review could unearth conversations likely to embarrass the president - and that public disclosure could cause him and his office political problems. Officials in the OMB have since worked to play down the investigation and its findings - claiming that Mr Mulvaney’s interaction with the department, which he remains head of while also serving as acting chief of staff, followed standard procedure. ""There was a legal consensus at every step of the way that the money could be withheld to conduct the policy review,"" OMB spokeswoman Rachel Semmel told the paper. ""OMB works closely with agencies on executing the budget. Routine practices and procedures were followed"".",0
"The University of Kansas athletic director Jeff Long issued an apology on Friday night following a controversial performance by Snoop Dogg during the school's ""Late Night in the Phog"" preseason celebration. The performance, which kicked off the Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team's 2019-2020 season, featured pole dancers, a money gun and profanity in front of a raucous crowd of 16,300 people at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas. ""We apologize for the Snoop Dogg performance at Late Night,"" Long said. ""We made it clear to the entertainers' managers that we expected a clean version of the show and took additional steps to communicate to our fans, including moving the artist to the final act of the evening, to ensure that no basketball activities would be missed if anyone did not want to stay for his show."" He added: ""I take full responsibility for not thoroughly vetting all the details of the performance and offer my personal apology to those who were offended. We strive to create a family atmosphere at Kansas and fell short of that this evening."" During the event, Snoop Dogg performed some of his famous hits like ""Gin and Juice,"" and ""Drop It Like It's Hot,"" complete with a team of pole dancers. He wore a Kansas Jayhawks Jersey and even shot fake money into the crowd, which ESPN reported featured his own face on the currency. While the performance isn't new for the rapper, the school is currently facing five NCAA Level I violations, including a lack of institutional control and a violation of coaching responsibilities standard. Those violations could result in serious penalties for the basketball program.

"The body of disgraced money man and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in his Manhattan federal prison cell in August, bore telltale signs of homicide despite an official ruling that he killed himself, a pioneering forensic pathologist revealed to “Fox & Friends” in an exclusive interview Wednesday. The bombshell claim by Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner who has worked on high-profile cases during a five-decade medical career, is certain to reignite suspicions that surfaced immediately after Epstein, who was awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges involving underage girls, was discovered dead in his cell on Aug. 10. Baden, who was hired by Epstein’s brother and observed the autopsy, told Fox News its findings are more consistent with homicidal strangulation than suicidal hanging. He noted that the 66-year-old Epstein had two fractures on the left and right sides of his larynx, specifically the thyroid cartilage or Adam’s apple, as well as one fracture on the left hyoid bone above the Adam’s apple, Baden told Fox News. “Those three fractures are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation,” Baden, who is also a Fox News contributor, said. While there’s not enough information to be conclusive yet, the three fractures were “rare,” said Baden, who's probed cases involving O.J. Simpson, President John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, record producer Phil Spector, New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez and many others. “I’ve not seen in 50 years where that occurred in a suicidal hanging case,” the 85-year-old medical legend told Fox News.Baden, who's examined more than 20,000 bodies and hosted HBO's ""Autopsy,"" explained that if a person weighed 120 pounds and their head weighed 10 pounds, there would be 110 pounds of pressure on the neck at the jaw during a hanging. But, if someone put a hand around a person's neck and squeezed, that could double or even triple the pressure on the neck, Baden said. There were also hemorrhages in Epstein’s eyes that were common in homicidal strangulation and uncommon, though not unheard of, in suicidal hangings, the forensic pathologist said. “The prominent hemorrhage in the soft tissues of the neck next to the fractures is evidence of a fresh neck compression that could have caused the death,” Baden said.Baden stressed his independent study was not complete. “The investigation is not completed until all the information has come in,” he said. Epstein was found hanging in his prison cell at the high-security Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan and was later declared dead, investigators said. Prosecutors alleged that the previously convicted sex offender paid girls as young as 14 hundreds of dollars for massages before he molested them in his homes in New York and Palm Beach, Fla., between 2002 and 2005. He was awaiting trial in federal prison, thus federal agencies -- presumably the FBI and Justice Department -- had jurisdiction over the investigation into his death, Baden explained.He said it was unknown to him and the Epstein family what work the feds may have done and what results they might have. The ligature, or item used to tie something tightly, allegedly was made from a sheet that had been twisted and put around Epstein’s neck, Baden said. Evidence on the cloth material could help prove whether or not someone else was involved in Epstein's death. “Whoever it is would have their DNA all over the ligature,” he said. “We don’t have those results yet,” he added, saying those results “should be reported quickly to give an idea and lessen the speculation.”New York City Medical Examiner Barbara Sampson ruled Epstein’s cause of death to be a suicide by hanging. “It appears that this could have been a mistake,” Baden said. “There’s evidence here of homicide that should be investigated, to see if it is or isn’t homicide.” But Sampson on Wednesday is standing by her findings. “Our investigation concluded that the cause of Mr. Epstein’s death was hanging and the manner of death was suicide. We stand by that determination,"" she told Fox News in a statement. ""We continue to share information around the medical investigation with Mr. Epstein's family, their representatives, and their pathology consultant. ""The original medical investigation was thorough and complete,"" she continued, adding that ""there is no reason for a second medical investigation by our office.” Epstein previously was discovered on July 23 -- over two weeks before his death -- on the floor of his prison cell with marks around his neck, after which he was placed on suicide watch. He was taken off suicide watch a week later and put in another cell with a roommate, Baden said -- but the second inmate was taken out a few days after that, leaving Epstein alone in the cell.On the day Epstein was found dead, the prison security had experienced a “total breakdown” in procedure, according to Baden. “It was determined that the two guards who were supposed to be working in that area of the prison had allegedly fallen asleep and hadn’t made their 30-minute rounds for more than 3 hours,” he said. Then there were security cameras that were supposed to be recording the cell and the hallway outside, to see who went in and out. Both apparently had malfunctioned, according to Baden. Mark Epstein, Jeffrey’s next of kin, had hired Baden to perform an independent investigation because the family wasn’t getting answers -- and if his brother’s death was, in fact, a homicide, “he and others may be at risk,” Baden said, “because of somebody not wanting knowledge given out.”Through his five decades of experience, Epstein’s death is not straightforward, Baden said. “It doesn’t give you the answer,"" he said. ""It's not a typical hanging case.”",0
"NEW YORK—Coming home from the Vietnam War, at the age of 21, Master Sgt. Kevin Gill experienced the kind of trauma no war could inflict. There was no welcome, no gratitude. After a year of service in Vietnam, Gill returned home in December 1971 and saw that time stood still for everyone else back on Staten Island. At that time, Americans were going through domestic turmoil. The anti-war, civil rights, and feminist movements polarized the nation. When the Marines, Air Force, and Army troops returned home from Vietnam, they were told to leave their uniforms at the airport to avoid civilian ridicule. And they did. For many veterans, rejection at home sparked anger. Some veterans fell into alcoholism and drug abuse; some committed suicide. Others, like Gill, picked up their bags and went back to war. “I had a dramatic change in my life, that’s why I kept everything in,” Gill said. It wasn’t until 20 years later that Gill heard the words he longed for in 1971. A veteran at the Desert Storm parade in Manhattan in 1991 told him, “Welcome home.” Another friend told him, “Thank you for your service” when they were having a casual conversation at a bar. The mention of gratitude stumped him. “I didn’t know how to respond to that,” he said. “Why didn’t you say this 20 years ago?” The phrase “welcome home” was coined as a greeting for Vietnam veterans. Even today, those aware of their history greet them with “welcome home.” “This is the best way we know to take [care] of each other, since no one else would back then,” said retired Marine Corps Gunnery Sgt. Thomas Lakin, who was called a “baby-killer” and nearly spat on when he returned from Vietnam. Opening Up to Move On Gill served in the Air Force for 35 years. He was in the Gulf War, the invasion of Grenada, Panama, Beirut, the embassy bombings, Rwanda, and has flown other secret missions. On Nov. 8 he sat at the library of the General Society of Mechanics & Tradesmen building in Manhattan and shared some of his experiences and the scars of trauma from the war. Gill is a dignified, timid, and playful Vietnam War veteran. He decided to share his story because he was told that opening up could do him good. He recently joined therapy programs run by the Department of Veterans Affairs. His eyes welled with tears as he spoke quietly, often hesitating. “Most of my life I wouldn’t admit that, but now I do have to, because good things come out of it,” Gill said. “It’s a great program. It’s saving lives. It’s helping people cope with it and continue their lives.” When Gill returned home in his uniform, people knew where he was coming from. Though he was confronted with denigrating looks from anti-war protesters, he always tried to be understanding. “I looked at the protesters protesting for us, protesting the war, but also protesting for their peers that were drafted,” he said. Gill volunteered for Vietnam, but decided to keep quiet about his service. “We wouldn’t say we were a veteran. It’s not just me but all of us just kept it quiet, because there was an attitude against us,” he said. Dealing With Trauma The problem with a negative reception back at home, was re-traumatization, according to Carolyn Alroy, a psychologist who dealt with 9/11 victims and has done research on the impacts of trauma. Alroy said that the negative reception after the trauma experienced during the war had tremendous consequences for veterans. “With trauma, the prognosis is always better when there are no prior incidents. The more trauma that you’re exposed to, the more difficult it is to bounce back,” she said. Times have changed, however, and especially so after the 9/11 attacks, which Gill said has to do with people’s realization of the importance of defense by those in the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. “The air is full of enthusiasm for veterans now,” he said. Gill said that trying to understand veterans is an important step in helping them cope. “If you see a veteran, talk to them,” he said. Bill Rajewski Sr. who served in Vietnam in 1966 as part of Marine Corps said that people expressing gratitude for his service and welcoming him home means a lot. Rajewski still remembers the people who offered him a better seat on an airplane. “All of these things and others trip emotions in me that I have probably suppressed for forty years or more,” Rajewski wrote in an email, adding that he gets emotional when hearing “Welcome Home” and “Thank you.” The Department of Veterans Affairs offers health care, benefits, and many other programs like therapy through art, which have recently benefited from more funding. Other programs like the Veteran’s Writing Workshop have sprung up recently too. Founder and instructor of the Veterans Writing Workshop at New York’s Fordham University, David Surface, said that when the program opened three years ago, most of his students were Vietnam War veterans. “These guys really are wrestling with what their stories mean. What was it worth?” he said. Most of the veterans who Surface dealt with just wanted to forget the past. They also wanted to meld into the scene of the American working class. For people like Gill, going back to the Air Force was the only way to deal with the war. “This was important for me, it probably saved my life. I was surrounded by people that understood.”",0
"In riveting testimony, a former national security official declared Thursday that a U.S. ambassador carried out a controversial ""domestic political errand"" for Donald Trump on Ukraine, an allegation undercutting a main line of the president’s defense in the impeachment inquiry. Fiona Hill told House investigators she came to realize Ambassador Gordon Sondland wasn’t simply operating outside official diplomatic channels, as she and others suspected, but carrying out instructions from Trump. “He was being involved in a domestic political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy,"" she testified, “and those two things had just diverged.” Hill’s comment followed a blistering back-and-forth during questioning from Republicans at the House hearing. Testimony from Hill and David Holmes, a State Department adviser in Kyiv, capped an intense week in the historic inquiry and reinforced the central complaint: that Trump used foreign policy for political aims, setting off alarms across the U.S. national security and foreign policy apparatus. Democrats allege Trump was relying on the discredited idea that Ukraine rather than Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election as he sought investigations in return for two things: U.S. military aid that Ukraine needed to fend off Russian aggression, and a White House visit the new Ukrainian president wanted that would demonstrate his backing from the West. One by one, Hill, a Russia expert at the White House’s National Security Council until this summer, took on Trump’s defenses. She and Holmes both told House investigators it was abundantly clear Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani was pursuing political investigations of Democrats and Joe Biden in Ukraine. “He was clearly pushing forward issues and ideas that would, you know, probably come back to haunt us and in fact,” Hill testified. “I think that's where we are today."" And Hill stood up for Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the Army officer who testified earlier and whom Trump’s allies tried to discredit.” He remains at the White House National Security Council. At one point, Republicans interjected, trying to cut off Hill’s response as she flipped the script during the afternoon of questioning. The GOP lawmakers had been trying to highlight her differences with Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union who delivered damaging testimony Wednesday about what he said was Trump’s “quid pro quo” pursuit of the political investigations. The Republican lawmakers eventually wound down their questions but continued with mini-speeches decrying the impeachment effort. Democrats, in turn, criticized Trump’s actions. Hill, a former aide to then-national security adviser John Bolton, sternly warned Republican lawmakers — and implicitly Trump — to quit pushing a “fictional” narrative that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in U.S. elections. Trump has told others testifying in the inquiry that Ukraine tried to “take me down” in the 2016 election. Republicans launched their questioning Thursday reviving those theories. Hill declared: “I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternative narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U.S. adversary, and that Ukraine — not Russia — attacked us in 2016.” Her testimony also raised fresh questions whether Bolton, who has yet to defy White House orders for officials not to testify, would appear in the inquiry. In what was seen as a nudge to her former boss, Hill said those with information have a “moral obligation to provide it.” The landmark House impeachment inquiry was sparked by a July 25 phone call, in which Trump asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for investigations into Biden and the Democratic National Committee. A still-anonymous whistleblower’s official government complaint about that call led the House to launch the current probe. Hill and Holmes both filled in gaps in previous testimony and poked holes in the accounts of other witnesses. They were particularly adamant that efforts by Trump and Giuliani to investigate the Burisma company were well-known by officials working on Ukraine to be the equivalent of probing the Bidens. That runs counter to earlier testimony from Sondland and Kurt Volker, the former Ukraine special envoy, who insisted they had no idea there was a connection. Holmes, a late addition to the schedule, also undercut some of Sondland’s recollections about an extraordinary phone call between the ambassador and Trump on July 26, the day after the president’s call with Ukraine. Holmes was having lunch with Sondland in Kyiv and said he could overhear Trump ask about “investigations” during a “colorful” conversation. After the phone call, Holmes said Sondland told him Trump cared about “big stuff,” including the investigation into the “Biden investigation.” Sondland said he didn’t recall raising the Bidens. During Thursday’s testimony, the president tweeted that while his own hearing is “great” he’s never been able to understand another person’s conversation that wasn’t on speaker. “Try it,” he suggested. Holmes also testified about his growing concern as Giuliani orchestrated Ukraine policy outside official diplomatic channels. It was a concern shared by others, he testified. “My recollection is that Ambassador Sondland stated, “Every time Rudy gets involved he goes and f---s everything up.” Holmes testified that he grew alarmed throughout the year, watching as Giuliani was “making frequent public statements pushing for Ukraine to investigate interference in the 2016 election and issues related to Burisma and the Bidens.” Hill left the White House before the July phone call that sparked the impeachment probe, though she was part of other key meetings and conversations related to Ukraine policy. She opened her testimony with an impassioned plea for Republicans to stop peddling an alternative theory of 2016 election interference and helping Russia sow divisions in the United States. “This is exactly what the Russian government was hoping for,” she said about the currently American political climate. “They would pit one side of our electorate against the others.” She warned that Russia is gearing up to intervene again in the 2020 U.S. election. “We are running out of time to stop them,” she testified. Trump — as well as Republicans on the panel, including ranking GOP Rep. Devin Nunes of California — continue to advance the idea that Russian interference was a “hoax,” and that it was Ukraine that was trying to swing the election, to stop Trump’s presidency. “That is the Democrats’ pitiful legacy,” Nunes said in his opening remarks. He called it all part of the same effort, from “the Russia hoax” to the “shoddy sequel” of the impeachment inquiry. Hill, who became a U.S. citizen in 2002, told lawmakers she was the daughter of a coal miner in the northeast of England, noting it is the same region George Washington’s ancestors came from. Hill said Bolton told her separately he didn’t want to be involved in any “drug deal” Sondland and Trump’s acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney were cooking up over the Ukrainian investigations Trump wanted. In Moscow on Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was pleased that the “political battles” in Washington had overtaken the Russia allegations, which are supported by the U.S. intelligence agencies. ""Thank God,” Putin said, “no one is accusing us of interfering in the U.S. elections anymore. Now they’re accusing Ukraine.""",1
"The move by a group of roughly two dozen House Republicans to ""storm"" the House sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF, compromising the secure space by refusing to turn over private cell phones or submit to other screening, has now ended. The extent to which the Republican action was intended purely as a pro-Trump publicity stunt can be discovered by looking at the list of participants: Twelve of those Republicans are actually on the three impeachment-relevant committees, and have had access to witness testimony from the beginning. A full 46 House Republicans sit on those committees, and all of them have heard witness testimony. (You may recall the constant presence of those members leaving each deposition to insist to assembled reporters that the testimony they were hearing was untrustworthy, or not at all damaging to Trump, or simply boring.) The latest updates: • Donald Trump himself reportedly approved the stunt, only the latest display of White House contempt for both the law and national security considerations. • Also approving the stunt in advance: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. McCarthy dismissed the security implications of Republican members bringing cell phones into the secure space, bafflingly telling a reporter, “These are individuals who have never been in Intel Committee before or anywhere else. So it’s nothing serious from that matter.” • Rather than the action being an unintentional oversight, some Republicans explicitly refused to turn over their unsecured cell phones to security when entering the facility. • Rep. Alex Mooney brazenly recorded a ""report from inside"" the secure space, the latest House Republican to brag about committing a national security breach. • Rep. Matt Gaetz's office handed out expired congressional passes to uncredentialed reporters and an HBO crew in an effort to boost publicity for the event. • Rep. Adam Schiff, who is leading the House impeachment inquiry: “Clearly the White House was devastated by yesterday’s testimony. These witnesses have been willing to defy the administration and follow the law and come testify so the president’s allies are trying to stop them through other means.” ",1
"Pennsylvania: Incredible: After Pennsylvania's Supreme Court struck down the GOP's congressional gerrymander earlier this year and replaced it with a fair map, Republican state senators have now responded by passing a constitutional amendment to gerrymander the court system itself. This amendment is designed to replace the Democratic majority on the high court with a Republican one, even if the GOP wins fewer votes statewide—as was the case with the state’s congressional delegation under the old map.This development is the latest Republican move to undermine genuine electoral reform in Pennsylvania. Recently, GOP lawmakers grabbed hold of a widely supported proposal to create an independent redistricting commission and turned it on its head with an amendment that would give the legislature full power to determine who would sit on the panel. This erosion of independence divided reform advocates despite reluctant support from some legislative Democrats, because a deadlock on the panel would return mapmaking power to the legislature. But now that Republicans have added judicial redistricting to the commission's purview, there’s no longer a divide: Reform groups have universally denounced it and all but two Democrats in the state Senate voted against it. (The House has yet to take it up.) Currently, judges on both the state Supreme Court and its two intermediate appellate courts are elected statewide; Republicans want to replace that system by dividing the state up into districts, which would give them the chance to draw lines that favor themselves. To justify this departure from current practice, Republicans are offering an almost comical pretext: The 31 judges who currently sit on these three courts hail from only 15 of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, so district-based elections would allow for greater representation of … counties. This, of course, is just a thinly veiled way to lie with statistics, because those 15 counties hold 58 percent of the state’s population. It’s as nonsensical as Donald Trump pointing to county-level election results to hide the fact that a majority of Americans live in counties he lost. More importantly, it should hardly matter how many counties are home to appellate judge, since judges do not “represent” voters (or counties!) the way that legislators do—their job is instead to interpret and uphold the law. And it should go without saying, but judges have no role in the sort of political deal-making that sees legislators seek to promote the economic or cultural interests of their particular districts. As absurd as these claims might seem, though, they mask a serious issue: the ongoing conservative assault on judicial independence, which has become part of a widespread trend among Republicans in state legislatures across the country over the last decade. When lawmakers like those in Pennsylvania refuse to stop gerrymandering, the courts have become the last resort for those fighting for fair elections. Attempts to gerrymander the judicial branch are a direct attempt to undermine efforts at reform, meaning they’re poised to become the next frontier in the GOP's crusade to subvert electoral democracy. Pennsylvania Republicans will probably be able to refer their amendment to the voters in time for the next round of redistricting, since it only takes a simple majority vote this year and then again after the 2018 elections to put it on the ballot. And because they've already gerrymandered their own districts, they're unlikely to lose their majorities this fall, so reformers will likely have to wage a fierce battle at the ballot box if the GOP proceeds with this power grab. We at Daily Kos Elections have long been opposed to the almost uniquely American institution of judicial elections because politicizing justice undermines its impartial administration. But since these elections aren’t going to be abolished anytime soon, they must at least be conducted in a manner that treats voters equally, regardless of their race or party. VOTER SUPPRESSION ● Indiana: A federal court has temporarily blocked Indiana Republicans from proceeding with a planned mass purge of voter registrations before an upcoming trial over the their attempt to implement the deliberately defective Crosscheck system developed by the notorious Kris Kobach. Crosscheck only uses voters' names and birthdates, which has been shown to produce numerous false positives for every potential case of improper registration. In granting the injunction, the court held that using Crosscheck to remove voters without notifying them would violate the National Voter Registration Act (aka the “Motor Voter” law). ● Missouri: Priorities USA, a top Democratic super PAC, has filed a lawsuit in state court arguing that Missouri's GOP-backed voter ID law violates the state constitution, even though Republicans won voter approval in 2016 to add a photo ID requirement to the constitution. The new suit argues that this amendment did not in fact negate another provision of the state constitution, one that guarantees the right to vote. As a result, plaintiffs say that the statute Republicans passed in 2016 to implement the amendment is itself unconstitutional. This latest challenge comes after a separate suit backed by the ACLU, NAACP, and the League of Women Voters was dismissed earlier this year. However, that case relied on a different legal theory, so it’s possible the outcome could be different this time. ● North Carolina: When North Carolina's Republican-run legislature is in session, we can expect a new voter suppression scheme just about every week, and this one is no different. With almost no warning or debate, GOP legislators introduced a bill on Thursday, which they passed on Friday, that would eliminate early voting on the final Saturday before Election Day. Since Republicans previously eliminated the final Sunday of early voting, this move would spell the end of all early voting during the weekend immediately prior to every election. A sizable majority of North Carolina voters typically cast ballots before Election Day, and early voting is disproportionately popular among black voters. Indeed, 200,000 people reportedly voted on the final Saturday before the 2016 elections. In addition, the early voting period is the only time when North Carolina law lets voters register and cast a ballot on the same day, which lowers the barriers to participation and has helped lead to higher turnout. Canceling the final weekend of early voting makes it even harder for to cast a ballot close to Election Day if they can't take off from work In a devious move, this bill also imposes financially burdensome restrictions on counties regarding when and where they have to offer early voting during the 17-day early voting period that would now end on the Friday before Election Day. The bill requires all counties to keep early voting sites that operate from Monday through Friday open from 7 AM to 7 PM, and it would require all early voting locations within the county to be open if any of them are, including on weekends. Currently, counties have flexibility on hours of operation and which sites to open, allowing them to determine how they can best allocate their resources to meet the needs of voters. This bill's inflexible requirement could consequently put a strain on county budgets, which could in turn prompt them to reduce the number of early voting locations and might also deter them from offering early voting even on weekends prior to the final weekend of early voting. In other words, by seemingly mandating more early voting hours, Republicans may have found a way to ensure less opportunity for early voting. Republicans hold veto-proof majorities in both chambers thanks to their legislative gerrymanders, and they can override a likely veto from Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper if they so desire. Consequently, Democrats and voting rights advocates will likely have to resort to yet another lawsuit to stop these changes and preserve existing access to the ballot. ● Ohio: On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court delivered a major blow to voting rights when it ruled five-to-four along ideological lines that Ohio's purges of infrequent voters did not violate the 1993 National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), commonly called the Motor Voter law. This ruling gives Republican-run states the green light to aggressively purge their voter registration rolls without informing nonetheless eligible voters that they have been removed, leaving them with no recourse if they show up to vote on Election Day. At issue in this case was the way in which Ohio Republicans, under the leadership of Secretary of State Jon Husted, have pruned voters who fail to vote in a given two-year period. If these voters don't respond to a single follow-up postcard sent to their homes and then subsequently don't vote in over the next four years, they’re taken off the rolls without further notice. The NVRA, however, prohibits states from purging eligible voters ""solely"" for exercising their right not to vote, and a federal appeals court found that Ohio’s purges violated federal law and ordered that roughly 7,500 voters be restored to the rolls ahead of the 2016 elections. However, the Supreme Court accepted the GOP's dubious argument that they weren't purging voters solely for failing to vote but for not responding to the mailer. Of course, as anyone who has ever discarded junk mail or has had something sent to the wrong address—in other words, practically everyone—would know, it's easy for these mailings to not get properly delivered or noticed by the voter, particularly if it's only sent a single time. Large numbers of voters could therefore wind up going to vote for the first time in several years only to find that they have been removed from the roll books. This of course appears to be exactly what the GOP wants, since these infrequent voters are disproportionately black and lean Democratic. Despite this adverse ruling, voting rights advocates are not without tools they can use to fight back against purges like these. While the Supreme Court ruled that these voter purges are allowed under the NVRA, it did not address whether they might violate the Voting Rights Act by discriminating against black or Latino voters. Indeed, in a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that if these purges have a discriminatory impact, they could run afoul of the Voting Rights Act. In one study she cited, majority-black neighborhoods in downtown Cincinnati saw 10 percent of voters removed due to inactivity since 2012, while a white suburban neighborhood had only four percent purged. Nevertheless, prolonged litigation can't be the only answer to stop these undemocratic purges of eligible voters, and there needs to be a permanent solution. If Democrats retake Congress and the presidency, they could amend the NVRA or even pass a new Voting Rights Act to override the Supreme Court's interpretation of the existing statute. They could also enact same-day voter registration nationwide, which would allow voters to register and cast ballots at the same time, eliminating the surprise of showing up at a polling location only to find you don’t have a valid registration. With Republicans in firm control of the federal government, congressional action is unlikely anytime soon. But in the meantime, Democrats can push to expand access to voter registration at the state level, and even use ballot initiatives to overcome recalcitrant legislatures. REDISTRICTING ● Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana: On Wednesday, a group affiliated with former Attorney General Eric Holder's National Democratic Redistricting Committee filed three federal lawsuits claiming that Republican congressional gerrymanders in Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana violate the Voting Rights Act (VRA) by diluting the power of black voters. If plaintiffs succeed, each state could be required to redraw its congressional map for the 2020 elections to create an additional district where black voters could elect their preferred candidates. However, the burden of proof on the plaintiffs is high. That's because in 2009, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court ruled that VRA lawsuits like these have to demonstrate that a hypothetical new district could be drawn with a majority-black population, even if a district without a black majority could nevertheless elect black voters’ candidates of choice. But if the plaintiffs successfully prove another majority-black district could be drawn, the VRA doesn't require the remedial district to have a black majority, as long as there’s a sufficient population of white voters who will back black voters’ candidates of choice—in practice, black Democrats. (We’ll delve into why this distinction matters below.) We can demonstrate how this might work with two hypothetical maps of Louisiana. Under the state’s current map, black voters are able to elect their preferred candidates in only a single congressional district, the 2nd.The plaintiffs will have to show that two majority-black districts could be drawn and that the black populations within them are reasonably compact. That map on the left does just that: The adult population in both the 2nd and 5th districts is just over 50 percent black in each case. If the court then agrees that this map satisfies the VRA and therefore requires the creation of a second seat where black voters can elected their preferred candidates, a remedial plan could look like the map on the right. That map created two districts where African Americans aren't a majority in either the 2nd or 6th, but black voters in each district would still be able to elect their preferred candidates thanks to the support of a minority of white voters. So why not adopt the first map? The second is preferable because it splits fewer communities of interest—for instance, it puts the urban core of the New Orleans area in a single district—and its districts are also more compact. Similarly, plaintiffs are arguing that Alabama should have drawn another black district in addition to the existing 7th District by connecting Mobile with the rural Black Belt and Montgomery, which you can see an estimation of in this hypothetical map where the 2nd and 7th districts are majority black. In Georgia, meanwhile, they’re claiming the state’s 12th District could have been made majority-black by connecting Savannah with the Black Belt cities of Augusta and Macon, which we we’ve approximated with this map that keeps the existing 2nd District plurality-black, as it currently is. As we mentioned above, it can be difficult to prevail in cases like these. However, if Democrats succeed, the Deep South could wind up with three more districts where black voters can elect their preferred candidates, ensuring a much more equitable distribution of congressional seats. FELONY DISENFRANCHISEMENT ● Louisiana: After their defeat in lower courts, the plaintiffs who are suing to overturn Louisiana's disenfranchisement of those on parole or probation for felony convictions will appeal to the state Supreme Court, where conservatives hold a majority. While Louisiana's GOP-run legislature surprisingly passed a bipartisan law in recent weeks to restore voting rights for those who have been out of prison for at least five years, that welcome change will still only affect three percent of those who are disenfranchised post-incarceration, so there's still a long way to go to correct this injustice. BALLOT MEASURES ● Maine: On Tuesday, voters in Maine chose nominees for federal and statewide office using the state’s new system for instant-runoff voting (IRV), both firsts in U.S. history. Voters simultaneously approved a referendum to keep IRV in place by a 54-46 margin, with 90 percent of precincts reporting at press time. That victory showed increased support for IRV (also called ranked-choice voting), which first passed at the ballot by a smaller 52-48 spread in 2016. Consequently, IRV will be used for Maine's primaries and for general elections at the federal level for the foreseeable future. However, it may not be put to use for state-level general elections, as we'll explain below. First, though, we’ll delve into the mechanics, since IRV is seldom-used in the United States (though it’s more popular in other countries). Maine’s new system lets voters rank their candidates in order of preference, choosing as many or as few candidates as they please. If no one wins a majority in the first round, the last-place candidate is eliminated and has their votes redistributed to their voters' subsequent preferences. This process repeats until one candidate obtains a majority. However, the “instant” part of the runoff isn’t necessarily so instant: Because of the particulars of how the state and municipalities administer elections in Maine, the counting in races where no candidate took a first-round majority will continue next week. So why did Mainers have to vote on whether to keep IRV in place less than two years after deciding to implement it in the first place? In short, hostility from the legislature. Because Maine doesn’t permit voters to propose their own constitutional amendments, the 2016 ballot measure only had the force of an ordinary statute, which meant that lawmakers could repeal it, as long as they were willing to subvert the will of the public. And indeed they were: Last year, nearly every Republican legislator, along with a handful of Democrats, voted for a law that would have effectively repealed IRV. To block this repeal, reformers put this latest measure on Tuesday’s ballot, a so-called “people’s veto” that has the effect of un-doing the legislature’s attempt to eliminate IRV. There’s another complication as well. Back in 2017, the state Supreme Court issued an advisory opinion saying that IRV ran afoul of language in the state constitution saying that only a plurality is necessary for a candidate to win a state-level election, such as a race for governor. (This wording doesn’t apply to primaries or to federal races of any kind.) However, the opinion was non-binding, so IRV is still technically set to be used in this fall's state races, and Republicans are all but certain to wage a new lawsuit asking the state Supreme Court to issue a binding opinion blocking IRV from the November ballot. It’s probable that IRV’s status could only be assured with an amendment to the state constitution, but because such amendments can only be put forth by the legislature, and because Republicans remain opposed to the idea, we’re unlikely to see that happen any time soon. That could change, though. Republicans have been hostile to IRV in general elections because of the perception that it would have cost them the governor's race in 2010, when a left-leaning independent split the vote with a Democrat and allowed Republican Paul LePage to win with just 38 percent of the vote. However, there’s reason to think that the continued use of this system will see Republicans warm to the idea over time. That’s because IRV isn't a system that favors Democrats but rather democracy itself, by ensuring a candidate can't win simply due to divided opposition. In fact, in the gubernatorial election immediate prior to LePage’s first win, Democratic Gov. John Baldacci won re-election ... with just 38 percent of the vote, again thanks to a divided field. If Republicans find themselves on the wrong side of another race like that one day, they may yet come around to the idea of enshrining IRV in Maine's constitution. ELECTIONS ● Wisconsin: Gov. Scott Walker and his Republican allies in the legislature went all-out in their efforts to leave two state legislative seats vacant for nearly a year because they were worried they’d lose them, but after multiple courts rebuked the GOP and forced Walker to call those special elections in March, Democrats indeed flipped one of those two districts on Tuesday. That victory cuts the GOP's majority to just 18-15 in the state Senate, boosting Democratic chances of breaking Republican control over state government before the next round of redistricting, which would allow them to block future gerrymanders.

"Fox News is infamous for ignoring inconvenient truths for Donald Trump and his Republican party. On Election Day 2017—one of the first truly consequential elections following the 2016 presidential—Trump booster Sean Hannity spent all of six primetime seconds on Democrats' convincing sweep in Virginia, New Jersey, and elsewhere. Don't blink, viewers! Or how about last year when the FBI executed a search warrant on the premises of Trump's longtime lawyer/fixer Michael Cohen? While every actual news outlet in America was riveted by the unfolding drama, GOP everyman Tucker Carlson dazzled his viewers with a segment on aggressive, sex-crazed pandas. But on Friday, as Trump lashed out at a seasoned U.S. diplomat in the midst of her sworn congressional testimony, Fox News was doing what every other actual news outlet in the nation was doing—covering the impeachment hearings. Trump's witness bullying was a bombshell most Fox anchors would have ignored on any other day. But because House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff stopped the hearing to read Trump's tweets and ask Yovanovitch if she wanted to respond, Trump's intimidation became part of a hearing Fox was already covering. ""This whole hearing turned on a dime when the president tweeted about her real time,"" noted Fox anchor Brett Baier. ""That enabled Schiff to then characterize that tweet as intimidating the witness or tampering with the witness, which is a crime. Adding essentially an article of impeachment real time."" In other words, Trump singlehandedly authored another article of impeachment. Wow, now that is some stunning straight talk on Fox. Fox News analyst and former Clinton investigator Ken Starr told viewers Trump had clearly not been advised by counsel to send such a tweet. ""Extraordinarily poor judgement,"" Starr remarked. ""The president frequently says, 'I follow my instincts.' Sometimes we have to control our instincts, so obviously I think this is quite injurious."" Nonetheless, Starr followed up with his personal conclusion that Trump's tweet didn't rise to the level of witness intimidation, but the damage was done. Just imagine, Trump watching real time in the White House residence as Fox News pundits questioned Dear Leader—he must have been fuming. But as delightful as it is to imagine Trump in his jam jams hurling his diet coke can at the TV, what really matters is the healthy share of Fox News viewers taking in any objective criticism at all of their chief. At the end of this year’s 3rd quarter, Fox News logged its 71st consecutive quarter as the most-watched cable news network in total day and prime-time viewership, according to Nielsen Media Research, averaging about 1.4 million daytime viewers and some 2.4 million prime-time viewers. But Fox's impeachment viewership is dusting those numbers. Of the 13.1 million viewers who tuned into the first day of the impeachment hearings, Fox claimed the greatest share of them with 2.9 million followed by MSNBC with 2.7 million. But it's the Fox viewers who are being treated to a reality check that they barely ever get glimpse of. ""It's not just the size of the their audience,"" noted MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace, who spent much of her career as a Republican spokesperson. ""It's that those are the viewers largely represented by Republican senators who will likely be the jurors in a Senate trial."" In fact, even House Republicans seemed to understand that Trump's onslaught was playing badly to the live audience back home, and they spent a great deal of time falling all over themselves to praise Yovanovitch, in stark contrast to Trump. As a Politico lede observed, ""Donald Trump is alone."" Indeed not a single GOP lawmaker backed up Trump's smear and not a single one challenged Yovanovitch's version of events. Instead, they sought to paint her as largely irrelevant as a fact witness since she hadn't personally witnessed many of the central elements at issue in the impeachment probe. But if House Republicans found Trump's conduct so repulsive they spent the next several hours doing clean-up, just imagine how the spectacle played to Senate Republicans, especially those in dicey reelection bids. Someone like Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner or Maine Sen. Susan Collins will live and die electorally based on how these hearings play to the suburbs in their states and whether that crucial slice of voters views them as independent from the president or inextricably linked to him. Just to be clear: It's not that we're suddenly going to see a wholesale defection of Fox News viewers from Trump, it's that the outcome of 2020 will likely be decided at the margins and every shaved half point here or there could actually be decisive. A Reuters/Ipsos poll taken after the first day of hearings and concluding before the second day showed that 68% of Americans reported following the hearings, including 28% who watched or listened to them live, while another 25% said they were not paying attention to the proceedings. And although the first day of hearings hadn't moved the needle much at all on support for Trump's impeachment (44%) versus opposition to it (40%), it did suggest the hearings weren't playing great for Trump. Among those paying attention, 41% said the hearings had made them “more supportive” of impeaching Trump, while 25% said they had made them “less supportive.” Whether public opinion moves further in support or opposition of impeaching Trump or simply serves to reinforce people's pre-existing views remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: We have never witnessed a TV event like this in the hyper-polarized Trump presidency. And as expected, Trump and his impulses are his worst enemy. This week alone, Trump singlehandedly authored an article of impeachment, further alienated the very female voters he desperately needs to get reelected, and put GOP lawmakers on the Hill in a box. And these were just the “2nd-hand, 3rd-hand, and 4th-hand” witnesses, as Trump's Republican allies stressed repeatedly throughout the week. Just imagine when the nation hears from people who directly listened to Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky or his boisterous cell convo with Ambassador Gordon Sondland, which was apparently overheard by at least three witnesses. Given that this was just the first week of hearings—the table setter as it were—it seems fair to say, the best is yet to come.",1

"George Soros’s Open Society Foundations is requesting action from Fox News/Fox Business after guest commentator Joe diGenova uncorked an anti-Semitic rant against Soros in a discussion on impeachment. On the Fox Business program “Lou Dobbs Tonight,” diGenova — a frequent guest on Fox News — said that Soros controlled a “very large” part of the State Department as well as unspecified FBI agents. “This is McCarthyite,” wrote Open Society Foundations President Patrick Gaspard in a letter to Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott. He requested an on-air retraction and the banning of diGenova from Fox air. The letter alights on a bitter and ugly history. In October 2018, Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch suggested on “Lou Dobbs Tonight” that Soros, a Jewish billionaire philanthropist and Democratic donor, was somehow responsible for a large migrant caravan approaching the United States via Mexico. ""A lot of these folks also have affiliates or are getting money from the Soros-occupied State Department and that is a great, great concern. We need to start cutting money — start cutting money there.” A Fox Business executive was forced to issue an apologetic statement: “We condemn the rhetoric by the guest on Lou Dobbs Tonight,” said Gary Schreier, Fox Business Network’s senior vice president of programming. ""This episode was a repeat which has now been pulled from all future airings.” Farrell would no longer appear on Fox Business or Fox News, the network declared. Months later, another guest on Fox Business — Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) — smeared Soros, earning a reprimand from host Stuart Varney. But perhaps the network’s most brazen and conspiratorial attack on Soros came Wednesday night, when host Lou Dobbs welcomed diGenova and Victoria Toensing to break down impeachment news. Toensing and diGenova are longtime Washington attorneys who frequent the program of Fox News host Sean Hannity and have done their level best to advance the argument that the real collusion in the 2016 presidential campaign took place between Democrats and Ukrainians against candidate Donald Trump. To further the intrigue, Toensing and diGenova have represented John Solomon, a former employee of the Hill who has written mortally punctured stories on Ukraine, President Trump, the Bidens and so on. In his discussion with the pair of conservative lawyers, Dobbs mentioned George Kent, one of two government officials to testify in Wednesday’s House impeachment hearing. As deputy assistant secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs, Kent is the senior State official overseeing Ukraine policy and has expressed misgivings about Trump’s maneuvers with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Dobbs said that Kent had tried to limit an investigation in Ukraine into an anti-corruption group supported by Soros. “This is a complicated deal here,” said Dobbs.With that, diGenova was off: Well, there’s no doubt that George Soros controls a very large part of the career Foreign Service at the United States State Department. He also controls the activities of FBI agents overseas who work for NGOs, work with NGOs. That was very evident in Ukraine. Kent was part of that. He was a very big protector of Soros. … The truth is George Soros had a daily opportunity to tell the State Department through Victoria Nuland what to do in Ukraine. And he ran it, Soros ran it. He corrupted FBI officials, he corrupted Foreign Service officers. And the bottom line is this: George Soros wants to run Ukraine and he’s doing everything he can, to use every lever of the United States government to make that happen — for business interests, not for good government. Where did that come from? When asked to elaborate by the Erik Wemple Blog, diGenova cited the “work of the award winning journalist, John Solomon,” his client and the progenitor of flimsy, tendentious pieces that bear the veneer of good old-fashioned investigative journalism. In August, Solomon wrote an article titled “George Soros’s secret 2016 access to State exposes ‘big money’ hypocrisy of Democrats,” which cites emails showing that Soros’s people had contacted then-Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland about various matters, including the European Union’s migration policy. In a phone call, Soros told Nuland that he’d pass along a draft of an essay he was writing on migration for the New York Review of Books. Solomon sums up: “Few people in the world could command the attention of one of America’s busiest, most influential diplomats for a pre-publication read of a column. Soros apparently was one of those few.” In a 2016 New York Review of Books essay, Soros advocated “surge” funding to deal with the European refugee crisis. “The refugee crisis poses an existential threat to Europe. It would be irresponsible to allow the EU to disintegrate without utilizing all the resources it has at its disposal,” wrote Soros. In concluding his article, Solomon writes: “Whatever political persuasion you hold, Soros’s election-year contacts at State speak volumes about the fact that big-money access to those in power is a bipartisan phenomenon.” From that premise, apparently, diGenova decided that Soros controlled the State Department, or at least a “very large” chunk of it. As Nadine Epstein writes in a short biography, Soros survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary — where he was born — and bolted to England in 1947, having experienced both Nazi and communist rule. Migration and refugee policy have been animating interests of Soros ever since. His Open Society Foundations has also funded government accountability efforts worldwide and has contributed 17 percent ($289,285) of Ukrainian anti-corruption group AntAC's funding through the end of 2018, according to the Wall Street Journal. In a CNN interview, Trump’s personal llawyer Rudy Giuliani, teller of far-fetched Ukrainian tales, said, “George Soros has a not-for-profit called AntAC.” Biographical facts and the like, though, are scarcely necessary to diagnose diGenova’s outburst for what it is: Stripped-down anti-Semitism. Here’s a tweet from Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League:In his letter to Scott, Gaspard — in addition to requesting a retraction and diGenova’s banning — also recommended an apology to the State Department and the FBI. “This is beyond rhetorical ugliness, beyond fiction, beyond ludicrous,” wrote Gaspard. ""It’s patently untrue; it is not even possible. This is McCarthyite. On behalf of Mr. Soros, founder and chairman of the Open Society Foundations, which I lead, I ask you what attorney Joseph Welch asked of Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, in one of the darkest chapters in this country’s history: “At long last, have you left no sense of decency?” The Erik Wemple Blog has asked Fox News/Fox Business for a comment and has not heard back.",1
"Online, he adopted the name of a Confederate cavalry leader dead for a century, hiding behind the persona to harass anti-fascists and further the goals of a white supremacist group, authorities said. He cradled an AR-15 style rifle in a Facebook selfie and commented, “coming to a synagogue near you.” He posed with a knife in a post threatening Muslims, and shared an image saying women with romantic partners outside their race should “get the f---ing rope,” accompanied by a drawing of a hanging.But away from his disturbing online presence, he was Fred C. Arena, a Salem County man who worked for a contractor at the Navy Yard in Philadelphia, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Arena was indicted late last month on charges that he lied to the FBI and on an application for a security clearance about his membership in Vanguard America, a white supremacist group that was seen at the 2017 “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. At a hearing in Philadelphia on Wednesday, federal prosecutors argued that Arena was too much of a risk to be released pre-trial. In a motion with several attached screenshots from Arena’s social media, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe LaBar wrote Arena’s family was unwilling to take him in, and he has lost his position at the Navy Yard. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Philadelphia confirmed Arena was held without bail Wednesday after the hearing, before Magistrate Judge David R. Strawbridge. Authorities say Arena mainly posted online with the name John S. Mosby, who was a Confederate colonel also known as “The Gray Ghost,” whose unit would strike Union supply lines. Other times, he was “Big 88” or Fritz, occasionally with a racist middle name. “He has expressed his desire to ‘get his hands on’ the witness he blames for focusing the attention of law enforcement on him,"" LaBar, the federal prosecutor, wrote. ""He has boasted of his skills at using the anonymity of internet ‘trolling’ as a weapon against those he feels have wronged him. He has a well-documented access to firearms.”Attorneys discussed whether Arena’s posts indicated an actual intent to commit harm. Prosecutors submitted several messages where Arena had bragged about breaking people who bothered him. At one point, he suspected an Antifa member of infiltrating a Vanguard group chat and claimed to have hired private investigators to “dox” members of the leftist group.“Offensive is one thing, acting out is another,” Strawbridge said before ordering him held, according to a report in the Philadelphia Inquirer.Arena, who was living in a hotel at the time he was arrested in October, had also threatened exes whom the FBI interviewed about the case, authorities said. “He threatened to sever intimate parts of the women’s bodies and store the parts in a jar,” LaBar wrote. He threatened to cut another ex’s throat. Brian Zeiger, Arena’s attorney, did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment Wednesday. New Jersey Homeland Security officials said the Vanguard group claims about 200 members in 20 states, including New Jersey. The group has shown itself in the state before through recruitment fliers on college campuses including Rutgers and Princeton. James Alex Fields, who is serving a life sentence plus 419 years for the murder of a protester in Charlottesville in 2017, was seen in photos with Vanguard members during the event.",1
"The United States has the worst overall child mortality rate compared with those of 19 other wealthy nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. That's according to a study published in the journal Health Affairs on Monday. The study examined child mortality rates between 1961 and 2010 in the US and comparable nations in the OECD, a group of 35 countries, founded to improve economic development and social well-being around the world. It found that mortality rates were not evenly distributed. ""This study should alarm everyone. The US is the most dangerous of wealthy, democratic countries in the world for children,"" said Dr. Ashish Thakrar, lead author of the study and an internal medicine resident at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Health System in Baltimore. ""We were surprised by how far the US has fallen behind other wealthy countries,"" he said. ""Across all ages and in both sexes, children have been dying more often in the US than in similar countries since the 1980s."" Some of the factors driving America's child mortality rate were related to infant deaths, automobile accidents and firearm assaults, according to the study. Why the US has worst child mortality Researchers analyzed data on mortality rates for children up to age 19 in the US, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The data, which dated from 1961 to 2010, came from the Human Mortality Database and the World Health Organization's Mortality Database. The researchers found that childhood mortality rates declined gradually from 1961 to 2010 for the US and the 19 other nations, which was a big success for public health. Yet the US rate fell at a slower pace than the other nations over those 50 years. Specifically, during the decade from 2001 to 2010, the researchers found that the mortality rate in the United States was about 75% higher for infants and about 50% higher for children ages 1 to 19 than the average rate calculated for all of the countries in the study. During that decade, other countries with infant mortality rates also above the overall average included Switzerland, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. Those with child mortality rates above the overall average were Ireland, Austria and Canada. New Zealand's child mortality rate was also significantly higher than average, similar to that of the US. Thakrar said the difference in the two nations' rates was not ""statistically meaningful."" Countries with infant mortality rates below the overall average included Sweden, Spain, Norway, Japan, Iceland and Finland. Those with child mortality rates below the overall average included Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Japan, Italy, Iceland, Germany and Denmark. Overall, for children of all ages between 1961 and 2010, Sweden had the lowest child mortality rate among all of the countries. As for America, ""we found that excess deaths in the US are concentrated among infants, from causes such as immaturity and SIDS, and among teens, from injuries,"" Thakrar said. ""Existing research has shown that infants die more frequently in the US, but this was the first time we were able to see that this trend started decades ago. We were also surprised by how much more often US adolescents, in particular boys, are dying from injuries,"" he said. ""The most disturbing new finding of this study was that a 15- to 19-year-old in the US is 82 times more likely to die from gun violence in the US than in any other wealthy, democratic nation."" The researchers wrote in the study's abstract that policy interventions could help to reverse these mortality rates in the US, such as by aiming to reduce the number of automobile accidents, assaults by firearm and infant deaths across the country. The study had some limitations. For instance, reporting, coding and classifications systems for death counts and cause-of-death data vary across countries. Those systems also have changed over the 50-year period analyzed in the study. Thakrar added that the study's data did not include demographic information, so the researchers were unable to examine disparities within US mortality rates. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report last week showing state-by-state and racial disparities in infant mortality rates, with Mississippi having the highest and Massachusetts having the lowest rate from 2013 through 2015. 'The future of any country is its children' There are just a few mortality-specific causes that help explain the discrepancies between the US and other countries, said Lindsay Stark, an associate professor of population and family health at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study. ""There were no major differences between the US and other countries in terms of infectious disease or cardiovascular disease, for example. The main reason the US is lagging behind other nations is because of perinatal mortality, including maternal conditions affecting a fetus or newborn, and injuries, mostly due to firearms,"" Stark said. ""What these findings clearly show is that there are areas where the US could be preventing child deaths, and we are failing to do so -- due to gaps in public policy, a weak social safety net and persisting social disparities that affect families', mothers' and children's health unequally,"" she said. ""The future of any country is its children, so at a fundamental level, we can see a country's investment in its future in the way children are surviving and thriving."" Thakrar agreed that many of the deaths behind the high mortality rates in the US are preventable. ""To turn around these trends, we will need to think beyond medical care to address the social environment children live in,"" Thakrar said. ""Every child deserves the opportunity to live a full, healthy and safe life. These findings show that we are not living up to that promise and that we have fallen short of that promise for the last 30 years.""",0
"Once repellent to conservative politicians, needle exchanges are now being endorsed and legalized in Republican-controlled states. At least four legislatures have considered bills to allow hypodermic needle exchanges, and two states, Georgia and Idaho, made them legal this year. In each of these states, the House and Senate are controlled by the GOP and the governor is a Republican. Florida, Missouri, Iowa and Arizona have introduced bills this legislative session that would allow needle exchanges in their state. The measures were all sponsored or co-sponsored by Republicans. As much as this has been a series of victories for public health officials who see how needle exchanges — also called syringe exchanges — stymie the spread of blood-transmitted diseases, it has been a triumph of public health policy research. For years, research has shown the benefit of needle exchanges, but now that the opioid epidemic and infectious diseases have affected their own communities, lawmakers are listening.“The reality is maybe 10 or 15 years ago this wasn’t where Georgia was,” said Republican state Rep. Houston Gaines, the sponsor for Georgia’s needle-exchange law. “But the medical and science community has shown that this works. My hope is as Republicans, we can always be willing to embrace programs and ideas if they’re proven to work.” Republicans have not always held this mindset. Needle-exchange programs, pioneered in Amsterdam in 1983, allow individuals to get sterile needles free of charge and safely dispose of dirty needles and syringes used for drug injection. The programs have been proved to reduce the risk of getting and transmitting HIV, viral hepatitis and other bloodborne infections through sharing needles. Syringe exchange programs also give public health officials an opportunity to offer educational and medical services, such as referrals to substance use disorder programs and HIV or hepatitis testing. Currently, 28 states and the District of Columbia allow needle exchanges. In 1988, Tacoma, Wash., established the nation’s first exchange program and with it came Republican opposition. North Carolina Republican Sen. Jesse Helms led Congress in banning the use of federal funds for needle-exchange programs that year. An ultra-conservative, Helms said allowing needle exchanges was the same as the government saying, “It’s not only all right to use drugs, but we’ll give you the needles.”Despite the federal government refusing to fund research on the exchange programs, public health evidence of their effectiveness started to stack up, as did the number of states allowing the programs. Multiple studies found that exchanges reduced the spread of hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV. These programs could also be cost-effective; a 2014 study found that for every dollar invested in expanding a needle exchange, $6 could be saved in HIV treatment. Other research found that going to an exchange program led drug users to enroll in substance abuse treatment programs. The tipping point for many Republicans, however, came in a 2015 HIV outbreak related to the injection-drug epidemic in Scott County, Ind., a strong GOP state. In a matter of months, more than 150 people were newly diagnosed with HIV in a rural county with 24,000 residents. Mike Pence, then the governor and now the vice president, was initially opposed to needle-exchange programs. Two months after the HIV outbreak was detected, Pence declared a public health emergency and allowed a limited needle exchange in Scott County. Pence’s White House staff did not respond to several requests for comment. Asal Sayas, director of government affairs at amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, said this was a critical moment for Republicans with rural constituents. “A lot of communities realized they were also vulnerable and had situations similar to Scott County, where there was minimal HIV care and no syringe exchange,” said Sayas.The syringe exchange in Scott County was effective, and it had a ripple effect. An analysis by amfAR found that after Scott County’s needle-exchange program, the number of exchange programs across the country spiked. The organization’s most recent count is at 320. Other Republican-leaning states also passed legislation allowing needle exchanges — Kentucky and Ohio in 2015, North Carolina in 2016 and Louisiana, North Dakota, Tennessee and Virginia in 2017. Though critics said Pence waited too long to implement the program, the move has been hailed by conservative state lawmakers who in the ensuing years began supporting needle-exchange programs. Attitudes among Republicans on the federal level are also shifting. In December 2015, three congressional Republicans from states hit hard by the opioid crisis, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Rep. Hal Rogers, both of Kentucky, inserted language into an omnibus spending bill that partially repealed the federal funding ban. That provision allows federal dollars to be used for operating needle-exchange program operations, just not for the drug-injection devices themselves. Following President Donald Trump’s recent announcement that he wants to end the HIV epidemic, Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar expressed his support for needle exchanges. “Syringe-services programs aren’t necessarily the first thing that comes to mind when you think about a Republican health secretary, but we’re in a battle between sickness and health, between life and death,” Azar said at the National HIV Prevention Conference in Washington in March. “The public health evidence for targeted interventions here is strong.” AmfAR’s Sayas said it’s important to remember how effective needle exchanges could be in achieving Trump’s HIV goals. “The administration’s plan targets 48 counties with high HIV diagnoses and seven states with a high rural burden of HIV,” Sayas said. “In six of those seven rural states, needle exchanges are illegal. If we’re serious about wanting this plan to work, we need to consider that.” Despite the movement among some Republicans to accept needle exchanges, 13 states still have laws that make them illegal. All of those have Republican governors and Republican-majority legislatures, except for Kansas, which has a Democratic governor. Nine states have either no law that prohibits syringe programs or only locally permitted needle exchanges, which means that it is up to each city or county to decide whether to operate needle exchanges. In states that have given localities control of needle-exchange programs, there has been some movement to shut down the programs. Charleston, West Virginia, suspended its needle exchange in 2018 after law enforcement officers complained about needles littering the streets and the mayor joined the opposition. Two programs in Indiana shut down in 2017 because of local opposition, although one has since reopened through a nonprofit health center. Republican Rep. Ed Clere was one of the authors of Indiana’s needle-exchange legislation. He said local control of the needle exchanges often means decisions now play out among local conservative lawmakers. “I don’t want you to think that I don’t like local approval. It’s just the way the approval process works, it just tends to be very political,” Clere said in an interview. “The people who make the decision, the commissioners, don’t have medical or research background. Instead of talking about the research evidence, the discussion ends up being about needles on playgrounds or drug use, which is just not useful.”",0
"Florida lawmakers have taken a significant step toward helping drug abusers get the care they need to survive and recover. On Wednesday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill that legalizes syringe exchange in the state, allowing counties to adopt a critical tool for reducing disease and promoting recovery among drug abusers. State lawmakers voted almost unanimously to pass the 2019 Infectious Disease Elimination Programs bill, which goes into effect July 1. In doing so, Florida joins nearly half of US states with laws on the books to protect needle exchanges, which have consistently been shown to help reduce drug abusers' health risks while keeping potentially dangerous used syringes out of public spaces. For years, lawmakers and pundits have expressed concern that syringe exchanges might promote intravenous drug use or other unsafe behaviors. In light of substantial evidence showing otherwise, however, and in response to the state's opioid epidemic and highest-in-the-nation HIV rates, Florida lawmakers came together across party lines to pass the bill unanimously in the state Senate, and with a vote of 111 to 3 in the House.As Kasha Bornstein and Austin Coye explained for the Orlando Sentinel this week, With decades of data on hand, the outcomes are clear: Syringe exchange programs prevent HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and deadly bacterial infections of heart valves and bloodstreams. Operating on the principle that we must help people survive if they are to recover, syringe services programs offer safe havens to people struggling with addiction, where they can seek nonjudgmental health care until they’re ready to quit, and a connection to rehabilitation once they are. Bornstein and Coye also pointed out that while the new law makes syringe exchange legal in the state, county lawmakers will still need to authorize local programs in order to get the practice up and running.Maria McFarland Sanchez-Moreno, Executive Director of the Drug Policy Alliance, praised the state's step toward harm reduction, as well as the ongoing efforts of Dr. Hansel Tookes of Miami, who's spearheaded the ""highly successful"" IDEA Exchange mobile syringe access program there for the past few years, and helped make the new bill a reality. “Florida is showing tremendous leadership by allowing the expansion of syringe exchange programs, which have proven to be highly effective health interventions,” Sanchez-Moreno said in a statement. “Particularly at a time of skyrocketing overdose rates, it is critical that policymakers adopt compassionate and evidence-based policies to protect the health of people who use drugs and others.” “Lives will be saved. HIV infections will be prevented,"" Tookes said in a statement. ""People who use drugs will be treated with compassion and have access to the help they need.” As Utah Public Radio reported, Miami's pilot syringe exchange removed more than a quarter million used needles from circulation over the past three years. ""By handing out Narcan — the drug that reverses opioid overdoses — the exchange has [also] prevented more than a thousand overdoses,"" UPR noted; it's also helped many Miami residents to get tested for blood-borne illnesses such as HIV and Hepatitis C, and to receive any necessary treatment. Alex Kral, an epidemiologist at RTI who's been researching syringe exchanges and opioid abuse for over 25 years, also emphasized the importance of Florida's promoting harm reduction rather than prison time for drug abusers. ""It's a very big step forward for Florida that was a long time in the making. It certainly doesn't mean the work is done, but this is really highly significant."" Kral explained that, for years, he's been tapped as an advisor during the drafting of similar syringe access laws around the country, based on his extensive research in this area. ""I have probably published over 50 papers on needle exchange by now,"" he noted. ""And at this point, what we're finding in terms of the HIV epidemic in the US among people injecting drugs is that needle exchanges are needed more now than ever before, and in a greater diversity of places."" Now that HIV epidemics are showing up alongside opioid abuse in smaller cities and towns, from Indiana to Massachusetts, Kral said, ""We're realizing that we [can't only fight transmission] through the main cities."" In terms of the broader impact of state moves like Florida's, Kral said, ""It offers all kinds of possibilities not just for big cities, and not just for HIV [prevention], but for engaging people on all of these topics.""Michael Collins, director of National Affairs at the Drug Policy Alliance, commented by phone that Florida's latest step could also have an important impact for communities across the country that are suffering under the opioid epidemic, partisan politics aside. ""Adding Florida to the list of states supporting syringe exchange, as a relatively red state, could be very helpful in moving federal opposition [to these programs], which includes a federal ban on funding for syringe programs and a ban on selling syringes."" ""We need to be providing direct funding for syringe programs and harm reduction tools,"" Collins continued. ""Florida, with its Republican senators and many members of congress, is adding pressure for the federal government to increase spending on such tools."" ""Adding Florida to the list of states supporting syringe exchange, as a relatively red state, could be very helpful in moving federal opposition [to these programs], which includes a federal ban on funding for syringe programs and a ban on selling syringes.""

""Florida, with its Republican senators and many members of congress, is adding pressure for the federal government to increase spending on such tools."" ""I think it's a really important step in terms of moving the country into the embrace of harm reduction programs,"" he added. ""If it can happen in Florida, it can happen anywhere.""",0
"Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin endorsed GOP Sen. Susan Collins for reelection on Thursday, in a rare rebuff of partisan politics in an increasingly polarized Senate. The moderate West Virginia senator also offered to campaign for the vulnerable Maine incumbent. It’s a boon for Collins, who Democrats likely need to beat if they hope to take the Senate majority in 2020. “I would go up and campaign for Susan Collins. If she wanted me to, I would campaign for Susan Collins. For America to lose somebody like Susan Collins would be an absolute shame. I feel that strongly about her,"" Manchin said on Thursday. He admitted his comments will not please Democrats eager to defeat Collins. “You think my party will be happy? No,"" Manchin said in an interview with C-SPAN’s “Newsmakers” program that will air beginning on Friday night. Though it's rare for a member of one political party to endorse another, Manchin and Collins are some of the few remaining moderates left in the Senate. And Manchin fundamentally disagrees with sitting senators campaigning against each other, making his endorsement of his Maine colleague a natural extension of his efforts to work across the aisle.

"A fan of Charles Manson and follower of Hitler, James Mason published essays in the 1980s that now act as the inspiration for a militant neo-Nazi group linked to multiple murders in the U.S. “Revolutionary discipline must mean that WE will be the single survivor in a war against the System,” Mason wrote in 1985. “A TOTAL WAR against the System.” But nowadays, Mason isn’t waging war with the system. He is, in fact, dependent on it. The 67-year-old white supremacist lives in a government subsidized apartment in Denver and eats at soup kitchens. In a brief interview last week, a few days after he was spotted picking up a meal at a city-run center for “homeless and hungry seniors,” Mason said he sees no contradiction between his writings and his lifestyle. “Guerilla warfare, man. Guerilla warfare,” Mason told NBC's Denver affiliate KUSA. “You’ve gotta take what you have to get what you need.” Mason’s old writings have gained new life with the rise of the Atomwaffen Division, a white supremacist group bent on overthrowing the government through terrorist acts and guerrilla warfare tactics. The extremist organization, whose name means “atomic weapons division” in German, formed in 2015 in the now defunct neo-Nazi online forum Iron March. Experts say it’s a largely decentralized group, small in size but large in ambition. “Members see themselves as soldiers preparing themselves for an impending race war,” said Joanna Mendelson, senior investigative researcher with the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism. “They create this apocalyptic worldview that their future is hanging by a thread. They paint a picture of a genocide and that they see themselves as needing to rise up against the tide that seeks their destruction.” In the past two years alone, men with ties to Atomwaffen have been accused of killings in Florida, California and Virginia. In the California case, an Atomwaffen Division member named Samuel Woodward was arrested and charged with fatally stabbing Blaze Bernstein, a gay, Jewish student, inside a park in Orange County in January 2018. Woodward pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. Experts say the group has greatly expanded the influence of Mason and his decades-old writings. His SIEGE newsletters, which have been posted on numerous online forums and compiled into a 563-page book, serve as Atomwaffen’s ideological foundation. “The enemy today is the U.S. Government itself and it is, by every standard of measure, the most evil thing that has ever existed on earth,” Mason wrote in a newsletter published in August 1980. “Can you picture a scenario like this: that great 'Silent Majority' has at last gotten fed up, found its wits and given the Nazis or the Klan a voter mandate,” he wrote in a latter section. “The Jews, the Blacks, and the assorted fanatic Reds, etc. least of all to mention the entrenched Capitalist System manned largely by sick, liberal Whites give up, say it was a fair fight, shake hands and turn it all over to us. It's just too crazy to contemplate.” Mason had largely faded into obscurity in the past two decades, but his writings are now seen as helping to fuel a rise in far-right extremism across the globe. Authorities in Germany and the U.K. told NBC News that Mason is influential among radicals in both countries. A British intelligence official said Mason’s writings served as inspiration for multiple far-right extremists who were arrested for unspecified crimes. The FBI declined to comment. Mason’s newfound relevance marks a sudden turn in the life of a man whose days of notoriety seemed long behind him. “James Mason was a dried up, has-been neo-Nazi who then had his work get reappropriated and given new life especially by groups like Atomwaffen,” Mendelson said. She described him as a “key figure within this movement and this subculture.” “He's put on a pedestal along with Timothy McVeigh and Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway,” Mendelson Mason, who was raised in Ohio and began working for the American Nazi party in his teens, has a lengthy criminal record. In 1991, Mason served a 30-day stint in jail after he pleaded guilty to illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material. After his release, Mason told The Cincinnati Enquirer he took lewd photos of a 15-year-old girl at the request of her husband. Mason moved to Colorado but his criminal problems followed. He was in and out of state prison throughout the late 1990s after he was convicted of menacing in a case involving sexual exploitation of a child, and later found to be in possession of weapons in violation of his parole. He now lives in a red-brick apartment complex in the heart of Denver. The building is open to people who qualify for “subsidized Section 8” housing, according to postings in the lobby. Building management confirmed that all of the apartments are designated for recipients of Section 8 vouchers, a federal subsidy that helps low-income people pay their rent. Mason’s apartment has become a magnet for Atomwaffen members. Photos posted online show Mason posing with various young men, some dressed in Nazi regalia and wearing skeleton face paint, in front of swastika flags. One of Mason's neighbors said she wondered about all of the men heading up to his apartment. ""At first when he had young men coming up there, I thought maybe he was a pervert, to be honest with you,"" said the 64-year-old neighbor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The neighbor described Mason as ""quite the gentleman"" and said he helped with the yard work and eagerly took part in activities like the building's Thanksgiving gathering. But the neighbor said she was stunned when one day last summer she saw signs posted nearby with Mason's photo and a message saying a neo-Nazi lived in the neighborhood. The neighbor went online and found his writings. ""For someone who doesn’t like the government, you’re living in government housing,"" she said. ""That right there kind of throws me."" In a typed letter, Mason initially declined an interview with KUSA for “purely tactical reasons.” But a reporter caught up with him this month. In the interview, Mason rejected the suggestion that Nazis have been in decline since losing World War II. “Look at the shape society is in. Look at the goddamned shootings. Look at the drugs. The suicides and the crime and everything else,” Mason said. “I say this country lost. And decade by decade I see my beliefs proven over and over again. We’re prophets. Nobody’s listening to us, but they’re going right off the cliff thinking we’re nuts.” Mason initially seemed to push back against the idea that his writing had inspired young neo-Nazis to commit violence. “If they were acting on my words, they wouldn’t be doing the things they’re doing,” he said. But Mason, who insisted he's not a member of Atomwaffen, followed with an ominous and ambiguous statement about the possibility of violence. “If you must do it, it seems to me to be only common sense that you’d want to do it right,” Mason said. “Because it’s the end of your life. You may die out there in the street via SWAT team, or you may spend the rest of your life in the joint. Make it count for god’s sake.” He did not elaborate.",1
"Originally set up as a place for gamers to chat, Discord has become wildly popular, attracting 150 million users and rising to a $2 billion valuation just last month. But with rapid growth has come disturbing criminal behavior. Thanks to previously unreported court filings, Forbes can reveal that Discord groups dedicated to cybercriminal activity are being investigated by the FBI. The groups are being used by low-level hackers to share stolen data, like usernames and passwords. U.S. cops are also warning about a handful of cases in which the chat app has been adopted by groomers to target children susceptible to online coercion. Founded by young entrepreneurs Jason Citron and Stanislav Vishnevskiy (a Forbes 30 Under 30 alum) in 2015, the site still bills itself as a home for gamers. It claims to have 150 million users and in 2017 had already outgrown another burgeoning communications startup, Slack.But with ballooning wealth and size comes trouble. In the last two years Discord has become a chaotic space, where innocent gamers' voices have increasingly intermingled with those of shady criminals, child groomers, hate-mongers and, most notoriously, white supremacists. Discord's founders declined to be interviewed for this article, but a spokesperson said its terms of service and community guidelines prohibited ""harassment, threatening messages, calls to violence or any illegal activity."" They also cover ""more expansive activities than other platforms’ rules such as doxxing and sharing private information."" ""Though we do not read people’s private messages, we do investigate and take immediate action against any reported violation by a server or user, which can include shutting down offending servers or banning users,"" the spokesperson added. ""We work closely with law enforcement agencies in their investigations when appropriate to ensure and strengthen the safety of our community members."" Hells Gate to stolen password heaven A search warrant unearthed by Forbes detailed an FBI investigation in Ohio into a particular Discord group called Hells Gate. It's the first evidence the agency has probed cybercriminal activity on the site. According to the warrant, the group was selling ""generated"" credentials. ""I believe the account credentials generated on the website belong to unwitting victims whose credentials have been stolen or are otherwise being used without permission,"" an FBI special agent wrote in the application for the search. Forbes later found an advertisement for a Hells Gate account generator that linked to Discord. For subscriptions ranging from $9 to $50, customers of the illicit trade could get access to thousands of online accounts, including cryptocurrency wallets, social media profiles and logins for pornography sites. A forum post accompanying the ad, from January last year, indicated Hells Gate was offering access to as many as 109,506 accounts.Discord banned the HellsGate server. And it's been putting out hacker-built fires elsewhere. Amongst the many examples of troublesome groups was one dedicated to SentryMBA, a tool that automates the process of inputting millions of leaked usernames and passwords on different websites in an attempt to gain access. Before its removal, David Shear, an analyst at U.S. cybercrime tracking company Flashpoint, watched over the SentryMBA community on Discord as members consistently shared lists of leaked passwords to provide ammunition for the tool, as well as updated versions. Another example was GiftCardKing, where a single individual provided custom-built account takeover software for various online websites.On top of those are areas of Discord where people's credit card information is sold, as well as chats about shoplifted goods and drugs. Though it appears most, if not all, of the above groups have been shut down by Discord, Forbes was quickly able to find similar live chats, one offering $100 Amazon gift cards for $50, another selling malware-as-a-service for a $115 lifetime fee. One particularly interesting group was FoxCult, where conversations focused on all manner of illegal activity, from using stolen credit cards and selling PayPal accounts with thousands of dollars of credit, to dumping information online.Such data salesmen and -women aren't the most trustworthy. Scammers are also often on the platform, according to security analyst Alex Holden. Typically they claim to have access to services and data when they don't, running off with buyers' funds and never appearing under their pseudonym on Discord again. Why hackers choose Discord Rafael Amado, senior strategy and research analyst at Digital Shadows, said Discord had become increasingly popular among digital crooks following the 2018 law enforcement takedowns of popular dark web drug and weapons markets AlphaBay and Hansa. Amado thinks Discord is believed by those ex-dark web denizens to provide an acceptable degree of anonymity. But to view Discord as a place safe from legal action would be entirely false. As the search warrants show, the site can and does hand over user information if the government comes forward with an acceptable request. Shear said data thieves know Discord doesn't provide true anonymity. Instead, Shear's running theory is that Discord has all the right features to quickly set up stolen data shops. Years ago, hackers would have to set up their own private spaces to communicate, known as IRC [Internet Relay Chat] rooms. Those chats would often get hacked or knocked offline with a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, noted Shear. ""With Discord, they have to worry about none of that for the most part,"" he added. ""The permissions system is simple to keep out people they don’t like, and on top of that—even when servers do get banned—they'll easily set up a new Discord server that day given how simple the creation process is. We've seen communities banned half a dozen times and still continue to operate within Discord."" After Forbes spoke with those that ran SentryMBA, it appeared Shear’s theories were on the money. The owner of the SentryMBA Twitter account said Discord was useful because of various easy-to-use and free features that were originally built for gamers to chat, in particular screen sharing and voice calling. Its Discord community of between 1,000 and 2,000 users were often sharing hacking tips, though the SentryMBA spokesperson said they didn't encourage illegal activity. ""We consider it as allowing freedom of speech for those who share a similar interest online,"" they told Forbes. ""We cannot deny the fact it is an extremely popular subject and as time goes on there are more and more people suffering from such attacks and these individuals must learn the importance of protecting yourself."" Child grooming on Discord? More disturbing than the rising cybercrime activity are a handful of cases where Discord has been used as the starting point for child grooming. Forbes found another previously unreported search warrant from 2017, which detailed the case of 22-year-old William Lee Dela Cruz, who was using Discord to contact an unnamed 12-year-old. The government claimed they'd used Discord to discuss, amongst other topics, having sex and masturbating. The chats came to light after the Jane Doe was reported missing, having disappeared with Dela Cruz in a vehicle, according to the search warrant, which detailed subsequent sexual activity between the pair. Dela Cruz was charged with one count of enticement of a minor and one count of travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct. (He is yet to face trial. Just last week, the judge in the case ordered that Dela Cruz would be hospitalized for treatment for up to four months, ""until his mental condition is so improved that trial may proceed."") This wasn't the first case of grooming reported on the site. Earlier this month, six men and one woman were arrested in Florida, accused of sexually exploiting two teenage girls. Warning about the predator use of Discord, police said at least one of the girls was first contacted by the accused over the platform, local media reported. The FBI was also reportedly involved in a 2018 missing child case in Mississippi, where police said a 14-year-old boy was lured over Discord. Other non-cyber crime has appeared on Discord in recent months too, as found in the search warrant that detailed the Hells Gate investigation. The subject of the search warrant, Stephen McQueen, was seen posting on Hells Gate about guns and marijuana, too, according to the FBI's narrative. McQueen was spotted chatting with another Discord user about growing weed, the search warrant application read. (The warrant, which sought DNA from McQueen, was not successfully executed and the case was terminated, according to the court docket. Forbes could find no charges against a Stephen McQueen in Ohio). Discord's identity problem Beyond these emergent issues, Discord has other problems. Notoriously, it has attracted a reputation as a hub for white supremacists. As the New York Times reported in 2017, Discord was moved to remove a number of alt-right chat groups following the now infamous Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, where a 32-year-old counterprotester was mowed down and killed. It appeared Discord wasn't able to keep hate speech out, though. In 2018, Slate reporter April Glaser joined more than 20 Discord communities ""that were either directly about Nazism or white supremacy or reveled in sharing anti-Semitic and racist memes and imagery."" That investigation and the criminal use of Discord reported here point to the obvious: Discord has become something far more unruly than the gamer-only site it was meant to be. A return to innocence might be impossible. Discord, at least, has money to throw at the problem. In December, it raised a massive $150 million. Shear believes Discord has to go beyond the whack-a-mole game it's currently playing, in which offending groups are simply banned. The company should work with researchers ""to address the pervasive nature of threat actors using Discord as their home."" ""Otherwise, it will be purely reactionary as it currently is,"" Shear added. But once messaging apps become attractive to criminals, it's hard to shift them. From Facebook to Kik, social tools have splurged millions in their attempts to cleanse nefarious types from their services. Thus far, their collective victories in the war on drugs, child abuse and cybercrime have been little more than symbolic.",0

Forbes later found an advertisement for a Hells Gate account generator that linked to Discord. For subscriptions ranging from $9 to $50, customers of the illicit trade could get access to thousands of online accounts, including cryptocurrency wallets, social media profiles and logins for pornography sites. A forum post accompanying the ad, from January last year, indicated Hells Gate was offering access to as many as 109,506 accounts. Discord banned the HellsGate server. And it's been putting out hacker-built fires elsewhere. Amongst the many examples of troublesome groups was one dedicated to SentryMBA, a tool that automates the process of inputting millions of leaked usernames and passwords on different websites in an attempt to gain access. Before its removal, David Shear, an analyst at U.S. cybercrime tracking company Flashpoint, watched over the SentryMBA community on Discord as members consistently shared lists of leaked passwords to provide ammunition for the tool, as well as updated versions. Another example was GiftCardKing, where a single individual provided custom-built account takeover software for various online websites. On top of those are areas of Discord where people's credit card information is sold, as well as chats about shoplifted goods and drugs. Though it appears most, if not all, of the above groups have been shut down by Discord, Forbes was quickly able to find similar live chats, one offering $100 Amazon gift cards for $50, another selling malware-as-a-service for a $115 lifetime fee. One particularly interesting group was FoxCult, where conversations focused on all manner of illegal activity, from using stolen credit cards and selling PayPal accounts with thousands of dollars of credit, to dumping information online. Such data salesmen and -women aren't the most trustworthy. Scammers are also often on the platform, according to security analyst Alex Holden. Typically they claim to have access to services and data when they don't, running off with buyers' funds and never appearing under their pseudonym on Discord again. Why hackers choose Discord Rafael Amado, senior strategy and research analyst at Digital Shadows, said Discord had become increasingly popular among digital crooks following the 2018 law enforcement takedowns of popular dark web drug and weapons markets AlphaBay and Hansa. Amado thinks Discord is believed by those ex-dark web denizens to provide an acceptable degree of anonymity. But to view Discord as a place safe from legal action would be entirely false. As the search warrants show, the site can and does hand over user information if the government comes forward with an acceptable request. Shear said data thieves know Discord doesn't provide true anonymity. Instead, Shear's running theory is that Discord has all the right features to quickly set up stolen data shops. Years ago, hackers would have to set up their own private spaces to communicate, known as IRC [Internet Relay Chat] rooms. Those chats would often get hacked or knocked offline with a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, noted Shear. ""With Discord, they have to worry about none of that for the most part,"" he added. ""The permissions system is simple to keep out people they don’t like, and on top of that—even when servers do get banned—they'll easily set up a new Discord server that day given how simple the creation process is. We've seen communities banned half a dozen times and still continue to operate within Discord."" After Forbes spoke with those that ran SentryMBA, it appeared Shear’s theories were on the money. The owner of the SentryMBA Twitter account said Discord was useful because of various easy-to-use and free features that were originally built for gamers to chat, in particular screen sharing and voice calling. Its Discord community of between 1,000 and 2,000 users were often sharing hacking tips, though the SentryMBA spokesperson said they didn't encourage illegal activity. ""We consider it as allowing freedom of speech for those who share a similar interest online,"" they told Forbes. ""We cannot deny the fact it is an extremely popular subject and as time goes on there are more and more people suffering from such attacks and these individuals must learn the importance of protecting yourself."" Child grooming on Discord? More disturbing than the rising cybercrime activity are a handful of cases where Discord has been used as the starting point for child grooming. Forbes found another previously unreported search warrant from 2017, which detailed the case of 22-year-old William Lee Dela Cruz, who was using Discord to contact an unnamed 12-year-old. The government claimed they'd used Discord to discuss, amongst other topics, having sex and masturbating. The chats came to light after the Jane Doe was reported missing, having disappeared with Dela Cruz in a vehicle, according to the search warrant, which detailed subsequent sexual activity between the pair. Dela Cruz was charged with one count of enticement of a minor and one count of travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct. (He is yet to face trial. Just last week, the judge in the case ordered that Dela Cruz would be hospitalized for treatment for up to four months, ""until his mental condition is so improved that trial may proceed."") This wasn't the first case of grooming reported on the site. Earlier this month, six men and one woman were arrested in Florida, accused of sexually exploiting two teenage girls. Warning about the predator use of Discord, police said at least one of the girls was first contacted by the accused over the platform, local media reported. The FBI was also reportedly involved in a 2018 missing child case in Mississippi, where police said a 14-year-old boy was lured over Discord. Other non-cyber crime has appeared on Discord in recent months too, as found in the search warrant that detailed the Hells Gate investigation. The subject of the search warrant, Stephen McQueen, was seen posting on Hells Gate about guns and marijuana, too, according to the FBI's narrative. McQueen was spotted chatting with another Discord user about growing weed, the search warrant application read. (The warrant, which sought DNA from McQueen, was not successfully executed and the case was terminated, according to the court docket. Forbes could find no charges against a Stephen McQueen in Ohio). Discord's identity problem Beyond these emergent issues, Discord has other problems. Notoriously, it has attracted a reputation as a hub for white supremacists. As the New York Times reported in 2017, Discord was moved to remove a number of alt-right chat groups following the now infamous Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, where a 32-year-old counterprotester was mowed down and killed. It appeared Discord wasn't able to keep hate speech out, though. In 2018, Slate reporter April Glaser joined more than 20 Discord communities ""that were either directly about Nazism or white supremacy or reveled in sharing anti-Semitic and racist memes and imagery."" That investigation and the criminal use of Discord reported here point to the obvious: Discord has become something far more unruly than the gamer-only site it was meant to be. A return to innocence might be impossible. Discord, at least, has money to throw at the problem. In December, it raised a massive $150 million. Shear believes Discord has to go beyond the whack-a-mole game it's currently playing, in which offending groups are simply banned. The company should work with researchers ""to address the pervasive nature of threat actors using Discord as their home."" ""Otherwise, it will be purely reactionary as it currently is,"" Shear added. But once messaging apps become attractive to criminals, it's hard to shift them. From Facebook to Kik, social tools have splurged millions in their attempts to cleanse nefarious types from their services. Thus far, their collective victories in the war on drugs, child abuse and cybercrime have been little more than symbolic.",0
"Originally set up as a place for gamers to chat, Discord has become wildly popular, attracting 150 million users and rising to a $2 billion valuation just last month. But with rapid growth has come disturbing criminal behavior. Thanks to previously unreported court filings, Forbes can reveal that Discord groups dedicated to cybercriminal activity are being investigated by the FBI. The groups are being used by low-level hackers to share stolen data, like usernames and passwords. U.S. cops are also warning about a handful of cases in which the chat app has been adopted by groomers to target children susceptible to online coercion. Founded by young entrepreneurs Jason Citron and Stanislav Vishnevskiy (a Forbes 30 Under 30 alum) in 2015, the site still bills itself as a home for gamers. It claims to have 150 million users and in 2017 had already outgrown another burgeoning communications startup, Slack. But with ballooning wealth and size comes trouble. In the last two years Discord has become a chaotic space, where innocent gamers' voices have increasingly intermingled with those of shady criminals, child groomers, hate-mongers and, most notoriously, white supremacists. Discord's founders declined to be interviewed for this article, but a spokesperson said its terms of service and community guidelines prohibited ""harassment, threatening messages, calls to violence or any illegal activity."" They also cover ""more expansive activities than other platforms’ rules such as doxxing and sharing private information."" ""Though we do not read people’s private messages, we do investigate and take immediate action against any reported violation by a server or user, which can include shutting down offending servers or banning users,"" the spokesperson added. ""We work closely with law enforcement agencies in their investigations when appropriate to ensure and strengthen the safety of our community members."" Hells Gate to stolen password heaven A search warrant unearthed by Forbes detailed an FBI investigation in Ohio into a particular Discord group called Hells Gate. It's the first evidence the agency has probed cybercriminal activity on the site. According to the warrant, the group was selling ""generated"" credentials. ""I believe the account credentials generated on the website belong to unwitting victims whose credentials have been stolen or are otherwise being used without permission,"" an FBI special agent wrote in the application for the search.

"Blogging platform Tumblr is reportedly being sold for less than $3 million — a mere fraction of the $1.1 billion spent to purchase the website over five years ago. Tumblr's current owner is Verizon, who took over the platform when it acquired Yahoo in 2017. But Verizon has apparently been looking to unload Tumblr since the beginning of this year, and now has agreed to sell it to Automattic, the company that oversees website publisher WordPress. Tumblr has more than 475 million blogs using its service, but the platform's value has plummeted since its glory days. Tumblr lost droves of users following its the decision last December to ban any posting of ""adult content,"" defined as media that depicts ""real-life human genitals or female-presenting nipples."" Automattic's CEO Matt Mullenweg has already shut down any hopes that Tumblr reinstate NSFW content under its new owner, saying that ""adult content is not our forte."" Business Insider has reached out to Tumblr for comment on the company's dropoff in valuation. It remains to be seen how, or if, Tumblr changes under its new owner. But to put Tumblr's current valuation into perspective, check out this list of items worth more than Tumblr's reported sub-$3 million price tag. $58.4 million — 'Balloon Dog' sculpture A piece of artwork from famed sculptor Jeff Koons sold at a Christie's auction in 2013 for $58.4 million. The sale set a record for the most expensive piece of art by a living artist sold at auction. The artwork, called ""Balloon Dog (Orange),"" is 12-foot-tall orange metallic sculpture designed to look like a balloon animal. $10 million to $20 million — Reddit when it was acquired in 2006. Publishing powerhouse Condé Nast purchased mega-forum platform Reddit in 2006 for a price estimated between $10 million and $20 million. The difference in price between Reddit and Tumblr makes sense: Reddit saw almost 1.7 billion visits in July, while Tumblr had around 380 million visits last month, according to web analytics firm Similar Web. $9 million — An empty lot in Palo Alto Rent in Silicon Valley is absurdly expensive. One example showing just how expensive real estate has become is this 11,000-square-foot property in Palo Alto, located at 1628 Bryant Street. The lot is completely bare, and is listed for $9 million. Realtors have said the price is so high because of its neighborhood: It's in Old Palo Alto, home to some of the tech industry's most rich and most famous, and is only blocks from Stanford University's campus. $8.9 million — Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' earnings in one hour. Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, is the richest man in the world, even after a recent divorce saw his net worth slightly diminish. But calculations by Business Insider in January broke down how much Bezos makes every second of every day. The estimations found Bezos earned almost $2,500 every second, and $8.96 million each hour. Current estimates are likely slightly lower than these projections: Bezos' net worth was $137 billion in January, but stands at $110 billion at time of this article's publication. $8.4 million — A thoroughbred racing horse In 2013, a one-year-old thoroughbred horse was purchased in the United Kingdom for a record-at-the-time $8.4 million. The horse was sold to Sheikh Joaan Al Thani, a member of Qatar's royal family, and set a record for the highest price for a horse in European auction history. $5 million — Beyonce's wedding ring Beyoncé and Jay-Z got married in a secret ceremony in 2008, and the wedding ring that appeared on Beyoncé's finger afterwards was hard to miss. The jeweler behind the 18-carat diamond ring priced the rock at more than $5 million. $4.5 million — 2014 Lamborghini Veneno Roadster When the 2014 Lamborghini Veneno Roadster debuted at a Geneva auto show, the car was priced at $4.5 million. The car is open-air, and can reach maximum speeds of 221 mph, but the carmaker says it's ""fully road legal."" Only nine of the ultra-exclusive car were put in production. $3.9 million — an 1,850-square-foot New York City apartment Units at Gramercy Square, a massive building located in New York's Gramercy neighborhood, range in price from $1.4 million studios to $6 million four-bedrooms. One two-bedroom unit measuring 1,850 square feet is currently available for an asking price of nearly $3.9 million. $3.5 million — A platinum bottle of Ley tequila Luxury tequila brand Ley produced the most expensive bottle of tequila in the world. While the tequila is top-notch liquor, the bottle itself puts the purchase at $3.5 million. The two-piece Ley Diamante bottle is made of platinum and features more than $4,000 white diamonds. $3.2 million — A diamond-encrusted iPhone 3GS Designer Stuart Hughes is known for producing luxury electronics, yachts, and clothing for the world's richest. The Goldstriker iPhone 3GS Supreme was created in 2009 for an Australian businessman. The phone was outfitted with over 130 individual diamonds, including a rose gold Apple logo and a gold home button. $3.2 million — First-edition Superman comic The comic book in which Superman makes his debut sold for $3.2 million on eBay in 2014. The comic book, ""Action Comics #1,"" cost 10 cents when it was first released in 1938. There's estimated to only be about 50 to 100 copies around today of the original Superman comic. $3.1 million — A 613-pound bluefin tuna The owner of a chain of sushi restaurants bought a bluefish tuna in January at an auction in Tokyo. The fish weighed 613 pounds, and sold for $3.1 million. Kiyoshi Kimura, who bought the fish, told reporters he paid ""a little too much."" $3 million — Victoria's Secret 2016 fantasy bra Each year (except for this year), the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show spotlights a multi-million Fantasy Bra laced with Swarovski diamonds and other pricey jewels. One of the most expensive bras in recent years is the 2016 Bright Night Fantasy Bra, worn by model Jasmine Tookes. The $3 million bra reportedly took over 700 hours to make, and sported more than 9,000 gems. However, the 2016 bra isn't actually the most expensive bra to grace the VS catwalk: Those in other shows, worn by big name supermodels like Heidi Klum and Gisele Bundchen, have topped $10 million.",0
"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Donald Trump Jr.'s appearance Sunday at a university to talk about his new book on liberals and free speech was marked by an argument between him and the audience over why he would not take questions, the Guardian newspaper reported . Members of the audience of about 450 people at the University of California, Los Angeles, were angry that Trump and his girlfriend, former Fox News personality Kimberly Guilfoyle, declined to take questions because of time constraints, the Guardian reported. Trump was at UCLA to promote his new book ""Triggered: How The Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us."" After initially being greeted with shouts of ""USA! USA!"" members of the audience eventually turned to louder, openly hostile chants of ""Q and A! Q and A!"" after they were told he would not take questions. The Guardian said that Trump told the audience that taking questions from the floor risked creating soundbites that left wing social media posters would abuse and distort. Guilfoyle told audience members that they were being rude. Shortly thereafter, she and Trump left the stage. Outside the lecture hall, several dozen protesters organized by the Los Angeles chapter of Refuse Fascism protested. The Los Angeles Times reports that protesters chanted ""UCLA protects fascists"" and ""humanity first."" Andy Stein, a supporter of President Donald Trump, told the Times that he came to UCLA to listen to Trump Jr. because he sees the son as a ""chip off the old block"" and admires his ""feistiness."" UCLA said in a statement that it was not a university-sponsored event, and allowing someone to speak on campus is not an endorsement of their views. ""The speakers were invited to campus by one of UCLA's more than 1,200 student organizations, all of whom have access to university resources,"" it said.",0
"President Donald Trump congratulated the People’s Republic of China for its 70th anniversary Tuesday morning. Senate Republicans were in no mood to celebrate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) compared China under President Xi Jinping to a “modern version of Maoist China” and criticized the government for violence against pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong and placing Uighurs — a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority group — in internment camps. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) warned that “an authoritarian China is perhaps the single greatest threat to freedom around the world,” while Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) emphasized that the 70th anniversary of communist rule was no cause for celebration but “a day to remind ourselves of the horrors inflicted on the Chinese people over this time.” Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said the American people stand with the “freedom-seekers in Hong Kong,” and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said the Chinese Communist Party has waged “economic warfare against Missourians through currency manipulation and tariffs targeting our farmers.” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a close Trump ally, said ""it has been a ghoulish 70 years of Chinese Communist Party control.” In the House, Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) lambasted the Chinese government's “appalling record of repression."" Those statements stood in stark contrast to the president’s remarks on Twitter. “Congratulations to President Xi and the Chinese people on the 70th Anniversary of the People’s Republic of China!” Trump tweeted. The disparate responses underscore the ever-growing gap between Trump’s foreign policy perspective and the views of most members of his party. Senate Republicans have voiced alarm at the violent protests in China. Over the summer, McConnell wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal warning Beijing would face consequences “if Hong Kong’s autonomy is eroded.” But while White House aides have encouraged the president to back the pro-democracy protesters, Trump has appeared reluctant to directly condemn Xi for the demonstrations — particularly as he tries to negotiate an end to a trade war that continues to spiral. Last week, during his speech before the United Nations, Trump went the furthest he’s gone in criticizing China for its response to the protests, saying his administration was “carefully monitoring the situation in Hong Kong."" “The world fully expects that the Chinese government will honor its binding treaty made with the British and registered with the United Nations in which China commits to protect Hong Kong's freedom, legal system and democratic ways of life,” Trump said. “We are all counting on President Xi as a great leader.”",0
"Back in 1963, when the term “baby-boomer” was first published in a Salt Lake Tribune article, it carried just one definition: a person born during the tail end or in the decade after World War II, when the United States saw a tremendous spike in births. Frequently shortened to “boomer,” over the years the phrase has been imbued with layers of meaning and implication. Much like “millennial,” “boomer” doesn’t merely indicate a person born in a given time or place, it’s a blanket term referencing the predominant trends, values and concerns of an entire generation. “Boomer” is also, evidently, an insult to an older person, who may or may not technically be a baby boomer. The development of the word as a pejorative is a pretty recent phenomenon, best exemplified by “OK boomer” — a phrase that has gained heavy traction on the social video app TikTok, among other internet platforms. Much like the poorly aged ‘90s slang “talk to the hand,” “OK boomer” is a derisive repudiation, a bit mocking in tone, like a verbal eye roll — and it’s directed specifically by a young person toward someone older. ‘OK boomer’ may be offensive to some, but it’s not a slur If you’ve spent much time on Twitter lately, you’ve probably observed ample activity around #OKBoomer and #boomer. In a now-deleted tweet, radio host Bob Lonsberry conjured a storm of controversy when he likened “boomer” to the N-word, claiming that it was an ageist slur — an allegation that John Kelly, senior research editor at Dictionary.com expertly negates. “You cannot compare the N-word to ‘boomer’; if you do, you’re fundamentally not understanding the power balance that goes with slurs,” Kelly says. “People in positions of power do not have slurs [attacking them] the way people in minority groups do — particularly groups that have historically been oppressed.” ‘Boomer’ has become a catchall phrase for someone older who is close-minded and resistant to change Nuance plays a profound role here: the term ‘boomer’ doesn’t precisely mean ‘baby boomer,’ not on the internet, anyway, where Kelly adds “we’re constantly navigating our identities."" “We’re not using ‘boomer’ per se to take down people who were born after World War II in the baby boom. We're using it in an ironic, often humorous, though sometimes malicious way as a catchall or stand-in for a set of attitudes. A ‘boomer’ [in this case] is an older, angry white male who is shaking his fist at the sky while not being able to take an insult. They have close-minded opinions, are resistant to change — whether it’s new technology or gender inclusivity — and are generally out of touch with how their behaviors affect other people.” Millennials are fed up with being shamed and silenced by boomers “OK boomer” may seem to have sprung out of nowhere, but it has been a long time coming. Millennials have been shouldering blame, shame and dismissal from older generations for years. “Millennials have faced extraordinary levels of student loan debt only to be told that they need to take unpaid internships or cobble together a living wage with part time work, [and] when we dare to complain, the boomers tell us that in their day, they put in their time and we have to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps,” says Caitlin Fisher, author of “The Gaslighting of the Millennial Generation.” “Yet the world they are leaving for us is a deck stacked against us. The minimum wage is not livable, health care costs are exorbitant (while many boomers rely on tax-funded health care programs and simultaneously tell us that socialism will be the downfall of society), living and education expenses are increasing far faster than wages keep up, and we're tired of being told we aren't allowed to complain.” Lindsey Turnbull, 30, an entrepreneur who works with teen and tween girls as the owner of MissHeard Media, finds that, in general, boomers shun the concerns of younger people, pointing to their lack of experience in life as grounds for their dismissal. “Gen Z are more compassionate and thoughtful with their language, [and in response] boomers decry them as PC police,"" Turnbull says. “Gen Z faces an unstable world due to climate and economic crises and the steady, visible rise of white nationalist populism. They feel boomers are not willing to acknowledge these real issues, let alone create solutions, and would rather chastise them for their age, looks or ability.” It’s worth noting, as Paige Hoveling, 33, of Halifax, Canada, underscores, that older generations have long been using the word “millennial” as an insult or rejection of younger folks — regardless of whether they’re technically millennials. “We've been trying to explain that the millennial stereotype is wrong to no avail,” Hoveling says. “[Boomers] just keep lobbing ‘millennial’ around like it's a swear; however, when we finally give up and find something humorous to combat it, boomers get very upset. Pot, meet kettle.” Turning ‘OK boomer’ into a chance for a conversation If you’re in the baby boomer age range and the term “OK boomer” doesn’t offend you, you’re probably not the type of boomer that the expression is calling out. Remember, this isn’t really about how old you are, this is about your attitude and how receptive you are (or aren’t) to the values and struggles of younger generations. But even if you aren’t offended by this slangy retaliation, it’s not exactly a pleasant or welcoming term. The idea of trying to start a dialogue with someone who slings “OK boomer” at you is not unlike that of politely opening the door for a person who just slammed one in your face. It brings us to the question: How can boomers bridge the gap with younger people who might just assume that they don’t understand, don’t care and have no interest in listening? “The ideal way to respond to [""OK boomer""], I think, is to get curious about it,” says Carla Bevins, assistant teaching professor of business communications at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, noting she deals mostly with college sophomores. “People want to be acknowledged and heard.” The reason ""OK boomer"" exists is because many Gen Z and millennials feel that they are not being heard or acknowledged. Take some steps back and reckon with that and do a bit of self-inventory to see how you might have contributed to this problem. Additionally, imagine what it’s like to be saddled with debt at 20 years old and to be told you should be buying a house instead of avocado toast. If someone calls you a “boomer” and it feels like the burn it was intended to be, ask yourself, “Why did that hurt? Why did I get an 'OK boomer'?” Bevins says. From there, you might want to try to unpack the phrase and say something along the lines of, “I get that I am not hearing you the way you want to be heard,” she explains. “‘Help me understand what I'm not getting. Let's have a cup of coffee and see if we can figure out what I did to get that [insult].’ You have to be willing to be vulnerable. From there, you can try to take the conversation in a better and more productive direction.” Ultimately, it’s a two-way street. If you’re slinging “OK boomer” at elders instead of embarking on a real conversation with them, you’re probably not going to see any change from people, and you’ll only deepen the divide, which very may well be your intention if you’re already fed up. Still, it’s worth cooling down and rethinking your strategy. Perhaps shunning boomers isn’t the answer for those looking to make constructive, productive change in the world. “You will not get someone to change their behavior by throwing ‘OK boomer’ at them,” Bevins says. “I talk a lot about audience analysis with my students. I ask, ‘What do you want your audience to feel?’ Think of this before considering what you want them to do. You’ll have to pick your battles and for some people this may not feel safe. It may not even be worth having the conversation, which as a communications professor, is tough for me to swallow. But my advice is to figure out where you can make the most difference and go from there.” ",0
"Sarah Reeves sat on her couch in Eugene, Oregon, staring at her laptop screen in furious disbelief. She was reading the website of a government agency, where her mother appeared to have posted a comment weighing in on a bitter policy battle for control of the internet. Something was very wrong. For a start, Annie Reeves, who loved to lead children’s sing-alongs at the Alaska Zoo, had never followed wonky policy debates. She barely knew her way around the web, let alone held strident views on how it should be regulated — and, according to her daughter, she definitely didn’t post angry comments on government websites. But Sarah Reeves had a more conclusive reason to feel sure her mother’s name had been taken in vain: Annie Reeves was dead. She died more than a year before the comment was posted. In the spring of 2017, a virtual war was raging over the future of the internet, much of it through comments on the website of the Federal Communications Commission — the government agency responsible for regulating the broadband industry. Reeves wasn’t the only ghost to get sucked in from beyond the grave to do battle on behalf of giant telecommunications companies such as AT&T and Comcast. At issue was a rule from the Obama era known as “net neutrality.” It was designed to protect the open web by requiring internet providers to treat traffic from all sites equally — and under Trump, the FCC was planning to scrap it. Conservatives had long branded the regulation as an assault on free enterprise, but advocates warned that its repeal would allow the broadband giants to manipulate traffic in favor of the highest-paying platforms, crowding out competition and stifling free speech. The stakes were high, and the public comment period attracted a staggering 22 million submissions. The problem was, many of the comments were fake. The New York attorney general opened an investigation and has since issued subpoenas to more than a dozen entities — estimating that “as many as 9.6 million comments may have used stolen identities.” But the FCC went ahead and scrapped the net neutrality rule in a massive victory for the broadband industry and a huge blow, consumer advocates said, for users. Some suspicious comments have been tracked back to particular political operatives. But the question of how millions of identities were marshaled without consent has largely remained a mystery. Until now. A BuzzFeed News investigation — based on an analysis of millions of comments, along with court records, business filings, and interviews with dozens of people — offers a window into how a crucial democratic process was skewed by one of the most prolific uses of political impersonation in US history. In a key part of the puzzle, two little-known firms, Media Bridge and LCX Digital, working on behalf of industry group Broadband for America, misappropriated names and personal information as part of a bid to submit more than 1.5 million statements favorable to their cause. The FCC proceeding is not the only public debate to have been compromised. BuzzFeed News also found that LCX, an obscure advertising agency based in Southern California, has worked on at least two other campaigns that raised similar impersonation allegations — issues that were so alarming that state legislators in South Carolina and Texas referred the matters to law enforcement. Media Bridge, a political consultancy based in Virginia, also participated in the South Carolina campaign. The rise of political impersonation threatens a core aspect of US democracy: the process by which federal agencies canvass public opinion before enacting new regulations. The process is not the same as voting, and the results aren’t binding — but they provide a forum for public debate, and officials are obliged to consider all viewpoints submitted, making them a crucible for lobbying by powerful interests. The internet has made it possible for these consultations to be conducted virtually, vastly extending their reach in an apparent leap forward for digital-era democracy. But there’s little stopping anyone from submitting statements under fake — or misappropriated — identities. The anti–net neutrality comments harvested on behalf of Broadband for America, the industry group that represented telecommunications giants including AT&T, Cox, and Comcast, were uploaded to the FCC website by Media Bridge founder Shane Cory, a former executive director of both the Libertarian Party and the conservative sting group Project Veritas. Cory has claimed credit for “20 or 30” major public advocacy campaigns in recent years, including, he says, record-setting submissions to the IRS, Environmental Protection Agency, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, and “probably a handful of others.” On Media Bridge’s website, the company has described itself as having expertise in “overwhelming government agencies” with avalanches of public submissions, and has publicly dubbed its approach to marshaling comments the “Big Hammer.” In the FCC campaign, Cory was working for Ralph Reed — a high-powered political strategist and titan of the Christian right who himself was working for Broadband for America. Cory, in turn, enlisted LCX Digital to find the commenters. LCX, which in the past has also worked with Mary Cheney, the daughter of former vice president Dick Cheney and a powerful political consultant in her own right, was cofounded by John Hilinski, a digital ad man with a record of deception. He has claimed publicly that he cofounded the search engine AltaVista, which he didn’t, and that he has a master’s degree in business administration from the University of Southern California, which he doesn’t. He has also claimed that he toured in the band Jane’s Addiction — another apparent fabrication. In a sworn deposition, a cofounder of LCX described the business as a “completely fraudulent” enterprise that had routinely faked data in its corporate work. Hilinski did not respond to BuzzFeed News’ requests for comment; nor did Broadband for America. A letter from Reed’s lawyer to BuzzFeed News said that any suggestion that he or his company, Century Strategies, “knowingly and willingly used the names and identities of individuals without their permission in comments” would be “false and defamatory.” Moreover, the letter said, Century Strategies had “directed its partners and vendors to follow above-industry standards, including requiring individuals to provide name, address, email, and phone number to verify who they are.” The letter added that “Century Strategies also was assured by these vendors that they utilized extensive data validation to verify all names and addresses using public databases.” Media Bridge also vigorously denied engaging in comment fraud. A letter from Cory's lawyer, Bob Barr, a former Georgia representative, accused BuzzFeed News of preparing a “hit-piece” and noted that “Media Bridge professionally submitted comments to the FCC without hiding its identity, and provided contact information in the event there were any issues with their submissions — unlike the individuals who submitted many millions of comments from adult websites, foreign accounts and clearly fabricated data sets.” LCX and Media Bridge are far from the only operators whose comment campaigns have been called into question. Fraudulent comments on both sides poured into the FCC during the net neutrality debate, and are an increasing problem for policymakers at the state and national level. Still, the way the LCX and Media Bridge were able to overwhelm the FCC with questionable comments lays bare a new weapon political consultants can wield to promote the interests of the powerful, with potentially shattering ramifications for democracy. “Spend a million dollars with Media Bridge,” Cory's company told prospective clients in a post on its website, “and most likely, you’ll have a million people + advocating for your position.” THE FIRST BATTLE The battle lines of the 2017 comment war over net neutrality were drawn in 2014. Tom Wheeler, President Obama’s appointee to head the FCC, announced the agency would consider two competing approaches to prevent internet providers from blocking or slowing down access to certain websites. Federal agencies publish thousands of proposals for new rules every year, and whenever they do, they are almost always required to put the plans up for comment. Anyone can weigh in, and the agency must take all viewpoints into consideration. Officials insist that it’s the substance of the comments — not the quantity — that counts, but agencies often do publish tallies, potentially giving a boost to whichever side of the debate assembles a better cheering squad. When the FCC opened the 2014 net neutrality proposal up for public comments, both the telecommunication industry, on the anti-regulation side, and progressive consumer groups, on the pro-regulation side, ran campaigns to flood the agency with responses from everyday Americans. John Oliver dedicated a 13-minute segment to the topic, introducing the once-obscure debate to a mass audience. Despite its boring name, “net neutrality is actually hugely important,” he told viewers, later drawing comparisons between internet providers and the Mafia, and suggesting that “Protecting Net Neutrality” be rephrased to “Preventing Cable Company F**kery.” At the end of the segment, Oliver exhorted his audience to send comments to the FCC supporting the cause. “We need you to get out there and, for once in your lives, focus your indiscriminate rage in a useful direction!” he said. “Seize your moments, my lovely trolls!” The broadband industry, meanwhile, plowed millions of dollars into lobbying campaigns to drum up opposition to the ruling. Cory says he helped the conservative nonprofit American Commitment muster nearly 800,000 submissions opposing net neutrality — a vast proportion of what was, at the time, the biggest-ever public response to a federal consultation, with nearly 4 million public comments. American Commitment claimed a “landslide” victory. Still, the FCC’s five commissioners voted 3–2 to pass a strong version of the net neutrality rule, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed. By 2015, the obligation to treat all traffic equally had been imposed on all broadband operators in the US. Then Donald Trump was elected. And his new appointee to run the agency, Ajit Pai, soon took aim at Obama’s “open internet” rules. When Pai opened the repeal plan for public comment in the spring of 2017, both sides of the debate squared up for a rematch of the earlier fight. Oliver again called on his viewers, causing such a flood of comments that the FCC’s website crashed. The telecom side got to work too. Suddenly, despite polling showing substantial support for net neutrality, Americans appeared to be flocking online to defend the rights of the telecom giants. Almost immediately, observers started sounding alarms. The tech publication ZDNet found that “anti-net neutrality spammers are flooding FCC's pages with fake comments” and that several people whose names appeared as commenters said they had not posted a word. Reporters at Gizmodo and the Verge found similar examples. Pro–net neutrality comments were called into question, too. Nearly 8 million identical one-sentence comments supporting the existing regulations were tied to email addresses from FakeMailGenerator.com. Many of those used plausible names but with nonsensical street-and-city combinations that do not exist. Another million comments, also supporting net neutrality, claimed to come from people with @pornhub.com email addresses. By the time the comment period closed at the end of August, the number of comments had obliterated all previous records, with more than five times as many as the last time the issue had come up for debate. In November 2017, New York state’s attorney general revealed that his office had been investigating fake comments for the past six months, but that the FCC had provided “no substantive response to our investigative requests.” ""My LATE husband's name was fraudulently used after a valiant battle with cancer,"" one person had complained to the attorney general’s office. “This is sickening,"" said another, whose mother’s name had been used to post a comment several years after her death. The day after the New York attorney general’s revelation, data scientist Jeff Kao published a remarkable finding. Using a technique known as “clustering,” Kao had found that 1.3 million comments were just iterations of the same template, generated by a computer but with certain words altered to make them seem like individual expressions of opinion. “President Obama's order to take over Internet access is a exploitation of the open Internet” was a common, ungrammatical phrase. Kao, who now works at ProPublica, also estimated that 99.7% of the “organic” comments — those that didn’t appear to be duplicates or prewritten — favored maintaining the Obama policy of net neutrality. But a few weeks later, on Dec. 14, Trump’s FCC voted to eliminate the rule — in a 3–2 decision that fell squarely along party lines. The broadband industry had won. By now it was clear that the public comment process had been severely compromised. But one thing nobody yet knew: how it happened. DIGGING IN BuzzFeed News began digging into the FCC comments nearly two years ago, submitting a Freedom of Information Act request to the agency that sought “server logs” corresponding to some of the comments Kao had identified. The FCC denied that request and later denied BuzzFeed News’ appeal. But a vital set of clues soon emerged. In anticipation of the intense interest in the 2017 net neutrality debate, the FCC had allowed people to upload comments in bulk using a Box.com account, which made it possible, in many cases, to trace who had submitted them. BuzzFeed News requested and received details of the comments that had been bulk-uploaded through the FCC’s new system, which were first pried loose by freelance journalist Jason Prechtel. BuzzFeed News ran large samples of the email addresses in those files through Have I Been Pwned, a website that identifies whether an address has been exposed in any of hundreds of major data breaches. The results were stark: In one particular group of 1.9 million comments, according to BuzzFeed News’ analysis, 94% of the email addresses belonged to people who had fallen victim to a hack known as the Modern Business Solutions data breach, in which millions of people's personal information, including full names, birthdates, home addresses, and email addresses, had been stolen. In 2016, a hacker had tweeted links to the breached data, which security researchers eventually traced back to an Austin-based data management company whose servers had been unguarded. All these comments were uploaded by Cory, using his Media Bridge email address. (Some of the comments were full duplicates; after removing them, there were just over 1.5 million comment-and-email combinations.) In its letter to BuzzFeed News, Media Bridge contested the idea that email addresses showing up in breached databases were a sign of improprieties. In fact, it said, a “high match rate” is a sign of validity, since most Americans appear in breached databases. Of course, there are many sets of breached data floating around the internet. But no other major uploaders of bulk comments to the 2017 FCC docket had such a close overlap with Modern Business Solutions — or any other cache of breached data documented by Have I Been Pwned, for that matter. None of the other major uploaders’ comments overlapped with Modern Business Solutions by more than 50%. (For more details on BuzzFeed News’ analysis, click here.) Upon closer inspection, BuzzFeed News determined that the group of comments Media Bridge had submitted included precisely the same algorithmically generated statements that Kao had discovered. (The rest of Media Bridge’s comments simply used one of a handful of prewritten statements.) Even the names, in some cases, were red flags. Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley and Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego — both Democrats — appeared to advocate against net neutrality, contrary to their party’s position. Merkley has previously said he didn’t write the comment attributed to him, and last year he called on the FCC to investigate its fake-comment problem. In a statement, Gallego said he had not known about the comment in his name until BuzzFeed News told him about it. “This constitutes identity theft and should and can be punishable by law,” he said. He called on the FCC and the Department of Justice to “take steps to determine who is behind this and to prevent this from happening again.” Rep. Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican, meanwhile, seemed to have weighed in from his Oregon home address rather than his House office, using an AOL email address rather than his official House account, despite the fact that as one of the most powerful legislators in the country he would have many more potent ways to make his views known. Walden never submitted that comment, a spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. Fictional characters had also chimed in: Boba Fett and Luke Skywalker made their cases against net neutrality, although they claimed to live in Colleyville, Texas, and Marietta, Georgia. In its response to BuzzFeed News, Media Bridge said its campaigns, ""like all others, rely on data that is inputted by individuals; which invariably includes comments from 'Star Wars' characters, politicians, other characters and even deceased individuals."" However, not only did the email addresses of Merkley, Gallego, Walden, Fett, and Skywalker all appear in the Modern Business Solutions breach, but the names and street addresses were exactly as they appeared in that breach, according to screenshots provided to BuzzFeed News by security researcher Bob Diachenko. A separate spot check by BuzzFeed News of 100 randomly selected Media Bridge comments revealed a similar pattern — even down to a street address that used underscores instead of spaces. A real person, such as Gallego, could certainly have their real information in a breached database and continue to use that real information as they moved around the internet, including submitting comments to federal agencies. But it seems impossible that so many people would have done so, including people such as “Luke Skywalker” supposedly living in a small town in Georgia. In defending its submissions, Media Bridge pointed out that the full universe of net neutrality comments in 2017 included five from “Hillary Clinton” and 15 from “Barack Obama.” That’s true — but none of those comments used contact information that matches data in the Modern Business Solutions breach — except for the one “Barack Obama” comment submitted by Media Bridge. CURIOUS MATH After finding the eyebrow-raising patterns in the 2017 net neutrality comments, BuzzFeed News searched for other batches of suspicious-looking FCC comments. Again, Media Bridge popped up. When the FCC was considering a new rule that would allow cable consumers to use their own set-top boxes — regulation that the cable industry opposed — about 100,000 comments were posted, over the course of a few days, using language from American Commitment. Among them was another comment attributed posthumously to Annie Reeves. One year later, 99.9% of those exact same names and addresses appeared on the FCC’s website, weighing in on an entirely different policy debate — net neutrality. They were uploaded by Media Bridge. It seems impossible that this could have happened the way Media Bridge claimed it did. Media Bridge or LCX would presumably have had to reach all those people and convince them to sign on to the new issue. The odds of being able to reach 99.9% of 100,000 people one year later are minuscule. Even if it were possible, the odds of convincing them all to submit yet another comment, on a topic only tangentially related, seem virtually nil. What’s more, those 100,000 comments also seemed to answer to a curious math question that had cropped up during BuzzFeed News’ analysis of the 2017 net neutrality comments. That analysis found that 94% of Media Bridge’s submissions had overlapped with the Modern Business Solutions breach. But what about the remaining 6% of submissions? BuzzFeed News has determined that almost all of them appear to have used commenters’ information recycled from 2016. BuzzFeed News also examined the 2014 net neutrality docket, which included — in addition to yet another Annie Reeves comment, using American Commitment’s language — a strongly worded sentiment attributed to Minnesota’s then-governor, Mark Dayton. Through a spokesperson, Dayton told BuzzFeed News that he didn’t write or even know about the comment. It was comments like these that allowed American Commitment to claim that it had “won” the original public consultation on net neutrality. In response to BuzzFeed News’ questions, American Commitment founder Phil Kerpen said the group “is proud of its record of success and integrity in helping citizens engage in the public policy process. We’re not getting distracted by rehashed smear and innuendo campaigns.” MEN OF LETTERS Efforts by Media Bridge and LCX have also aroused suspicion outside of Washington. In February 2018, lawmakers in South Carolina were “flooded” with emails opposing legislative efforts that they said would endanger the multibillion-dollar sale of Scana Corporation to Dominion Energy. South Carolina House Majority Leader Rep. Gary Simrill found something suspicious about the correspondence. Among the emails he received was one from his good friend, William Barron. Why would Barron — whom he speaks to often and had seen within the past week — send him a form letter? He decided to try responding to the email. But when Simrill clicked to reply, the email address that popped up was one he had never seen Barron use. Perplexed, Simrill phoned Barron. “Someone’s impersonating me,” Barron told local reporters. “It’s very discouraging, and it reeks of fraudulence.” Simrill notified his Republican caucus colleagues. None could find a constituent who said they had really sent the correspondence, Simrill told BuzzFeed News. The Consumer Energy Alliance — an industry group whose members include Dominion, as well as ExxonMobil, Chevron, and BP — had solicited the letters. Seeking to clear its name, the group called on the South Carolina attorney general to open an investigation into what had happened. Simrill requested an inquiry as well. In a recent interview in his Rock Hill office, Simrill reflected on the broader implications. ""It poisoned the well,” he told BuzzFeed News. “Now when you get an email ... you think, ‘Is this fake advocacy or someone who really needs something?’"" According to a source, CEA had hired Media Bridge for the letter-writing campaign, and the firm had enlisted LCX. In response to BuzzFeed News’ questions about the campaign, CEA said it had “conducted an internal review of the data we had received from vendors and determined there were discrepancies in the submission information.” The organization said it had decided to stop “engaging in this type of comment solicitation” until there are enough safeguards in place. And then there was LCX’s work in Texas. In early 2017, Texas lawmakers received a blizzard of more than 17,000 letters urging them to pass legislation that would subsidize homeschooling and private school tuition. Allegations of foul play quickly emerged. One of the formulaic letters addressed to Drew Springer, a Texas state representative, was allegedly signed by his predecessor, Rick Hardcastle — which would have been a bizarre mode of communication for two people who knew each other well. Hardcastle said the letter was fake. “I'm not a voucher guy and everybody knows I'm not a voucher guy,"" he told a reporter. After that, Springer said he called dozens of people named in the letters he’d received; none recalled sending them. Soon, another legislator referred the matter to the Travis County District Attorney’s Office, which opened an investigation, only to close it a year and a half later without making public findings. The campaign had been organized by Texans for Education Opportunity, a nonprofit seeking to promote “school choice” policies. Each of the lawmakers that had been targeted received more than 500 letters, according to data the organization provided to the Texas Tribune. When the Tribune started asking questions about the data, Texans for Education Opportunity referred them to its advertising vendor, LCX Digital. LCX defended its work, saying that the high volume of letters had been generated by digital ads inviting constituents to send messages to their representatives. The nonprofit also defended the letters in a statement to the Tribune, calling them “credible and uniquely verifiable.” But Stacy Hock, the chair of the board, later told BuzzFeed News that her group hadn’t even known LCX existed until the allegations surfaced. The organization hadn’t hired them; it had hired Mary Cheney’s political consulting firm, which in turn had hired LCX. The former vice president’s daughter has helped run comment campaigns since at least early 2014, when her prior consulting firm ushered at least 98,000 comments into a State Department docket in support of the Keystone XL pipeline. After the Texas letters came under scrutiny, she defended LCX, according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News. Hilinski had been in the industry for decades, Cheney noted, and had worked with billion-dollar companies. Plus, she said, the anomalies the Tribune had found in the data didn’t prove fraud — any mass outreach campaign was inherently bound to include a few inaccuracies. But a review by BuzzFeed News of the same data found striking abnormalities. The most remarkable pattern concerned the timestamps in the data. If LCX’s data is to be believed, Texans were just as likely to sign the letter at 3 a.m. as at 3 p.m. — or any other hour of the day, for that matter. But that’s not how people normally behave online. A typical person’s internet activity peaks during the most common waking hours and crashes after that. The IP addresses listed in the data also raise questions. All 11 people listed from Keene, Texas, for instance, purportedly approved their letter-signing through IP addresses on a specific address range owned by Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which is headquartered more than a thousand miles away in New York City. Hock told BuzzFeed News that these findings are “alarming.” She said Cheney’s firm had “launched an internal review” and was “demanding answers from LCX.” And depending on what those answers were, she said, “we will determine our future course of action, up to and including legal action.” In a statement, Cheney added that at the time of the allegations, her organization had done “spot checks” of the data and found “nothing out of the ordinary.” However, she said, a more recent analysis “has raised some abnormalities which we have demanded that LCX explain. We are awaiting their response.” Neither organization said it had heard back from LCX. ""COMPLETELY FRAUDULENT"" It’s not the first time people who have worked with Hilinski have been left with serious questions about what he was up to. Hilinski founded LCX in September 2007 over breakfast with three collaborators at a scenic diner on the pier in Newport Beach, California. In its nonpolitical work, the firm has won deals to advertise for major corporations. Its current website includes a “gallery” featuring advertisements for big-name brands such as Mazda, Toyota, and Pampers. But one of the cofounders left the company early on, and Hilinksi’s relationship with another eventually soured. In 2011 that partner, Jeff Marder, sued over his share of the profits. The case was settled before it went to trial — but not before Marder had given a deposition full of scorching allegations against his former partner. The company, he said under oath, was “completely fraudulent.” The way LCX made money, according to Marder’s deposition, was by misusing personal information that it had purchased elsewhere, claiming falsely that people had offered up their own details while signing up for its clients’ deals or services. “When did you first acquire the knowledge of the fraud?” LCX’s lawyer asked. “From the very beginning,” Marder responded. A few moments later, the lawyer asked: “And this enterprise that was engaged in this fraudulent activity derived 100 percent of its income from this fraudulent activity?” “That's correct.” “It didn't have any other business?” “No.” In other arenas, Hilinski has made false claims about his own biography. Hilinski has presented himself — on LCX’s website, on social media, and via press release — as having cofounded AltaVista, the famed search engine of the early internet. But there’s no trace online of Hilinski’s role. And Louis Monier, who is well-documented as being one of AltaVista’s actual cofounders, told BuzzFeed News that Hilinski “has never been involved.” Then there was his claim in a 2016 tweet that he had “toured in Janes addiction many years ago.” ""We don't recognize that name at all,"" said Peter Katsis, who manages the band. LCX’s website has also claimed Hilinski “holds an MBA from USC.” But a spokesperson for the University of Southern California said “There is no John Hilinski listed” in the degree records for the university’s Marshall School of Business. Sitting in her living room that evening two years ago when she saw the comment in her mother’s name on the FCC’s website, Sarah Reeves logged on to Facebook and posted angrily in all caps: “WOW IT SURE IS GOOD MY DEAD MOTHER HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT NET NEUTRALITY ISN'T IT.” She and her sister tried to figure out how to get their mother’s comment removed from the site, but the FCC doesn’t provide a way to do that. ""I think that was one of the worst things for me,"" she told BuzzFeed News. She had also found a comment in her own name, which BuzzFeed News has identified as among Media Bridge’s uploads. Unlike her mother, Sarah Reeves did have opinions about net neutrality — she was strongly in favor of it. But this comment espoused exactly the opposite stance. ""By the end of the day, I was pretty defeated,"" she said. The repeated appropriation of her mother’s name still frustrates Sarah Reeves. ""It's too easy to post fraudulent comments,"" she said. ""It gave us this impression that it didn't matter how we actually felt."" ●",0
"So the United States has “the world’s highest rate of children in detention.” Is this worth reporting? Maybe, maybe not. Nevertheless, Agence France-Presse, or AFP, and Reuters did report it, attributing the information to a “United Nations study” on migrant children detained at the US-Mexico border. Then the two agencies retracted the story. Deleted, withdrew, demolished. If they could have used one of those Men in Black memory-zappers on us, they would have. Sheepishly, the two news organizations explained that, you see, the UN data was from 2015 — part of a border crackdown that had begun years earlier. We all know who the president was in 2015. It wasn’t evil, child-caging monster President Trump. It was that nice, compassionate, child-caging monster President Barack Obama. Zap. The story made Obama look bad. Hence the story was removed. Not updated or corrected, removed. I know it’s a heavy news environment. Who can keep up? But try to remember this one, because it’s instructive. People think news organizations flat-out fabricate stories. That isn’t often the case. Fake news is a problem that pops up here and there, but the much more systematic and deeply entrenched attack on truth is the casual, everyday bias of reporters. AFP and Reuters deleted a story that was, in a narrow sense, true — that a UN study claimed the United States had some 100,000 children in migrant-related detention. The United Nations is horribly biased against America and the West. Still, on the level of lazy, news-release-driven journalism, the locked-up-kids story was minimally valid. At any rate, what the agencies didn’t seem to like was the story’s changed implication: That Obama, rather than Trump, locked up a lot of children. This is what’s important: Not that AFP and Reuters deleted a story, but that the implication of the story meant everything to them. Every time you read something from AFP and Reuters (and CNN and the Washington Post), you should be thinking not “This is fake news” but: “What’s the agenda?” To paraphrase Chuck Schumer’s infamous, and instructive, comment on the CIA, news outlets have six ways from Sunday of getting you to think what they want you to think, none of which involve making up stuff. One is simply not reporting things. News that isn’t mentioned didn’t really happen to that outlet’s consumers. Obama’s approval ratings were mostly really low, comparable to Trump’s, typically in the low to mid-40s. Polls would come out saying this, and the Ron Burgundys would simply not report it. Trump doesn’t enjoy this courtesy. Nor can he be associated with good news. A recent Newsbusters survey found that, over a recent six-week period, not even 1 percent of network news reporting on the Trump administration even mentioned positive economic news. Another trick is soberly reporting the policy proposals of Politician One but focusing entirely on the miscues and petty controversies of Politician Two. You might, if you are a news consumer, be under the impression that Sen. Elizabeth Warren has a sober, well-reasoned set of plans. These plans are, however, so far-fetched as to be breathtaking. She has vowed $20.5 trillion in new federal spending, an increase of 40 percent on top of current levels. Yet Warren isn’t the candidate the media habitually portray as unhinged. Meanwhile, the gaffes of Democrats attract very little interest; network news basically ignored the mini-scandal involving Pete Buttigieg, who promoted a list of black supporters, many of whom either were not black or did not support him. The networks declined to cast Buttigieg as racially insensitive. Still another trick is deciding that a matter that advances the wrong narrative is simply “local news,” hence not worthy of attention from the major outlets. Any crimes committed by illegal immigrants can be safely ignored by CNN, but any crimes associated with right-wingers become cause for national dismay and soul searching. CNN did a massive story this week involving the talents of five reporters after someone at Syracuse University sent out a white supremacist manifesto to “several” cellphones and racist graffiti was discovered in a residence hall. Previously, similar outbreaks of campus fear turned out to be based on hoaxes. Yet if this story dissolves, CNN can accurately claim, hey, we were just reporting that students were scared. The impression created by a thousand stories like this — that America in 2019 is a white supremacist nightmare — will linger all the same. Using, or ignoring, facts in accordance with whether they create the desired impression is the principal agenda of today’s media.",0
"Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Thursday that he is running for his old Senate seat from Alabama, with a message in which he addressed head-on his rocky relationship with President Trump. ""When I left President Trump's cabinet, did I write a tell-all book, no,"" Sessions said in a brief video posted on his website. ""Did I go on CNN and attack the president, nope. Have I said a cross word about the president? Not one time and I'll tell you why. First, that would be dishonorable. I was there to serve his agenda, not mine. Second, the president is doing a great job for America and Alabama and he has my strong support."" Sessions joins a crowded field vying for the Republican nomination to run against Democratic incumbent Doug Jones next year. Sessions stepped down as attorney general last year after Trump repeatedly berated Sessions for recusing himself from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian involvement in Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Sessions spent 20 years in the Senate before joining the Trump administration and championing the president's crackdown on illegal immigration. Sessions' former colleague, GOP Sen. Richard Shelby, earlier said he would endorse the former attorney general and believes he can win. ""He ought to win that race, but he has to win it on the ground,"" Shelby said, insisting that Sessions would be a ""formidable candidate."" Two other former colleagues, Sens. Roy Blunt of Missouri and John Barrasso of Wyoming, told Politico they would endorse Sessions. However, other GOP senators were noncommittal and the National Republican Senatorial Committee will remain neutral, the website reported. Sessions joins an already crowded field including Rep. Bradley Byrne, former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, state Rep. Arnold Mooney and Roy Moore, who lost the special election to replace Sessions to Democrat Doug Jones in 2017.",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer said on Wednesday he had no involvement with the issue of military aid to Ukraine, a key point in the impeachment inquiry into Trump, according to an interview. Asked on Blaze TV if he ever discussed the U.S. aid, withheld by the Trump administration over the summer, with American diplomats, Giuliani said: “The reality is the whole issue of military aid didn’t come up until I finished the assignment they gave me. I never discussed military aid with them.” ",0
" (CNN)Two weeks of dramatic and incriminating public impeachment testimony did little to sever the strong bond between President Donald Trump, his Republican supporters and conservative media propagandists. In fact, the more damning the suggestions of an abuse of power become, the deeper it forces Trump's defenders into his wild brew of conspiracy theories, disinformation and distortion. Trump is facing accusations that he withheld nearly $400 million in military aid and other recognition for Ukraine to try to force it to investigate a domestic opponent -- Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden -- and 2016 Democrats. But despite an impeachment case that solidified in two weeks of public testimony, there are increasing signs that the President's aggressive approach and mastery over the Republican Party in Washington is preventing any slippage of support from allies as Democrats prepare to pause the inquiry for Thanksgiving. Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy on Sunday ignored the expertise of US spy agencies, congressional probes and the first half of the Mueller report to lend credibility to Trump's claim that it was Ukraine that meddled in the 2016 election. Asked by ""Fox News Sunday"" anchor Chris Wallace whether he believed Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential race, Kennedy answered: ""I don't know, nor do you, nor do any others."" ""It could also be Ukraine. I'm not saying that I know one way or the other,"" Kennedy said. Kennedy was embracing a fresh attempt by the President to cast doubt on the evidence of what US intelligence agencies say was Moscow's operation to undermine faith in the 2016 election, denigrate Democrat Hillary Clinton and to help Trump win. The President's effort seems designed not only to give him a motive for leaning on Ukraine for an investigation but also to indulge his anger at any suggestion his win in 2016 was not legitimate. He is also trying to build a narrative ahead of a Senate impeachment trial that he was actually the victim of an international conspiracy -- not the perpetrator of one. The latest counter-attack by the President comes with his White House, as is the case almost every Monday morning, consumed by new controversies that popped up over the weekend. There is confusion over the exact circumstances of the firing of Navy Secretary Richard Spencer over the disciplining of a Navy SEAL to which Trump objected. And several media reports and document releases over the weekend appeared to support the testimony of several witnesses last week that the off-the-books diplomatic scheme in Ukraine was wider than it first appeared. A uniquely Trumpian approach to impeachment In retrospect, advice from political savants for Trump to treat impeachment like former President Bill Clinton -- ignore the noise and keep on working for Americans -- seems quaint and so 20th Century. Instead, Trump has pioneered his own unique strategy -- ignore the mounting pile of damaging testimony and convince his supporters to dismiss the evidence of their own eyes. This is an approach consistent with the President's famous comment in a speech to veterans last year: ""What you are seeing and what you are reading is not what's happening."" Its effect is to create a wave of confusion and false narratives that undermine or swamp the true facts of the Ukraine scandal and diminish the potency of the most damaging witness accounts. And such is Trump's political omnipotence among his supporters that he effectively gives his GOP allies a choice -- engage with the evidence and cross him or join his fact-fogging operation. Key witnesses, solid evidence, the words of acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and even the President's own words in the rough transcript of his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggest very strongly that there was an attempt to coerce Ukraine. Yet House Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said last week that ""I think it was very clear there was no quid pro quo"" and held out the call with Zelensky as proof of no wrongdoing, even though it seems to show quite the opposite and alarmed several senior national security officials. McCarthy confidently predicted that no Republicans would break from the President in the House impeachment vote -- in a sign of how tribal politics now dominates Washington institutions and how Trump's power dominates the GOP on Capitol Hill. New York Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin did not go quite as far as Kennedy on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday but did create an equivalence between Russian and Ukrainian election meddling. ""I believe that Russians interfered in the 2016 elections,"" said Zeldin, citing intelligence assessments. ""It's also true, it's indisputable that there were Ukrainians who interfered in the 2016 election,"" Zeldin said. On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Republican Sen. Roger Wicker said that Ukraine -- as well as Russia -- interfered in the US election. ""I'm concerned about both. I'm concerned about both,"" Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, said. Such comments work for Trump on two levels. First they give credence to his conspiracy theory that Ukraine tried to bring him down in 2016 and that he is correct to demand an investigation. And second, they give the impression that Russia and Ukraine are equally bad, that the email hacking, social media campaigns and approaches to the Trump campaign by Russians were less sinister than they appear. While there are instances of Ukrainian politicians criticizing candidate Trump, there is no evidence of the kind of broad government-sanctioned effort by intelligence agencies to interfere in the election as Russia did. What is particularly astounding about this spectacle is that the Republican Party -- which prides itself as having won the Cold War by facing down Moscow -- is effectively buying into a conspiracy theory energetically advanced by Russia itself. US intelligence officials who briefed senators in recent months have reiterated the point that Russia has been engaging in a years-long effort to shift the blame of Moscow's interference in the 2016 election to Ukraine, CNN reported Friday. This was a warning echoed by Trump's former top Russia expert Fiona Hill in her stunning testimony last Thursday. ""Russia's security services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election,"" Hill said. ""We are running out of time to stop them. In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests."" Trump leads the post-hearings charge Trump set the tone for the post-hearings propaganda campaign late last week. He showed up on ""Fox and Friends"" on Friday morning with a new offensive to discredit the fact pattern painstakingly laid out by investigators and former officials. ""I think it's very hard for them to impeach you when they have absolutely nothing,"" Trump said. He claimed he hardly knew most witnesses who testified — including US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who spoke about his expletive-laden calls with the President. Trump accused former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch -- who was pulled home after apparently getting in the way of his back-door foreign policy scheme -- of refusing to put up his photo in her embassy. The President did not provide any proof for his assertion. The tactic supported Trump's effort to prove that he's the victim of a ""deep state"" conspiracy by elite bureaucrats who have long conspired to throw him out of office. And he again described his notorious July 25 phone call with Zelensky in which he asked for a ""favor"" and a probe into the Bidens as ""perfect."" In this way, the President, who made millions understanding the value of rebranding, is seeking to repackage the most damning single piece of evidence against him. The GOP faced several choices after two weeks of hearings that built a strong case that the President abused his power to demand Ukraine to help him damage a domestic political opponent. It could have acknowledged troubling facts corroborated by non-partisan career officials that Trump was pursing his own interests, not America's, in foreign policy towards a key ally. Or the party could have expressed discomfort with Trump's behavior, but argued that Democrats did not prove their case conclusively — though such an approach was complicated by the White House refusal to provide key evidence and witnesses. But there are also principled arguments to be made that while the President might have dishonored the expectations of his office, the polarizing national trauma of impeachment would overmatch the gravity of his transgressions. Given that an election is looming in less than a year, such an argument might have practical as well as political resonance. Then Republicans had a third choice: embrace Trump's campaign of denials and distortion designed to bury the case in a confusing layer of conspiracy theories and untruths. House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes blazed the trail for Trump defenders, with opening statements in last week's hearings that sounded like conservative media monologues. His committee counterpart, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, who sat stone faced through the grandstanding by Nunes last week, said Sunday that even without Republican buy-in, Democrats were pressing ahead. ""At the end of the day, we have to decide what our constitutional duty is, even if our colleagues in the GOP and Congress have decided they're more committed to the person and the president than their constitutional duty,"" he told Jake Tapper on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""If this was Barack Obama had done this, they would have voted to impeach him in a heartbeat with a fraction of the evidence,"" Schiff said. ""It shouldn't matter this is a Republican president.""",1
"Cranberry producers in Massachusetts, and around the country, are slowly drowning in surplus fruit. For years, harvests in the three major cranberry-producing countries — the United States, Canada and Chile — have swelled, while many consumers have turned away from sugary beverages like cranberry juice. As a result, the global supply of cranberries has outgrown demand, and many Bay State growers have been pushed to the brink of failure. ""We're in what I think is a really tough spot right now,"" said Dom Fernandes, a third-generation cranberry grower in Carver, Mass. His company, Fresh Meadows Farm, is struggling to break even. ""I would've loved to have seen this farm stay in our family for another generation, and I'm not optimistic about that,"" he said. If things don't turn around soon, Fernandes expects his family won't be the only one looking to leave the industry. ""We're seeing consolidation take place, we're seeing small full-time growers switching to small part-time growers, and we're also seeing growers looking to simply walk away,"" he said. In 2008, a Massachusetts grower could expect to fetch around $58.60 per barrel of fruit, according to data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). By 2018, the price fell to $22.30 — a 62% drop. To make matters worse, the ongoing trade war between Washington, D.C., and Beijing has put a tight squeeze on international cranberry sales. As the Trump administration prepares for a new round of trade talks, Chinese tariffs on American cranberries remain in place, adding to the economic pain growers are feeling. However, the makings of the current cranberry glut were visible as early as 2012. And it was around that time that the industry, in search of new customers, focused its marketing muscle on China. The bet was that the world's most populous country might just be big enough to soak up that excess fruit. But there was a little problem: Most Chinese consumers had no idea what a cranberry was. Selling an unknown fruit At the 2019 International Fruit Expo, held this summer in the sprawling southeastern city of Guangzhou, the smell of opportunity was in the air. Or maybe it was the aroma of durian, the famously pungent fruit that its haters — and even many of its lovers — say smells like gym socks. For three days, the convention hall was transformed into a sort of indoor marketplace, with vendors from dozens of different countries beckoning passersby to their stalls with trays of chopped fruit. Among the goods: Vietnamese durian, Iranian figs, Taiwanese pineapple and Indonesian snakeskin fruit (which, if you're wondering, looks like a pear injected with python DNA; the booth that sold it had run out before this reporter could find out how it tastes). For any business trying to get a foothold in China's $7 billion imported fruit market, trade shows like this one are a chance to introduce products to new taste buds and, hopefully, find an importer who can provide a gateway into the world's second-largest economy. ""In terms of market size, definitely all the producers want to come here,"" said Pablo Aguayo, who was there to promote Mexican produce. One purveyor of Indian royal mangoes sold 216 boxes in just three days. ""The Chinese people are buying!"" exclaimed the vendor, Daddu Raman, who said he'd been collecting business cards from various importers. There is a palpable sense that if you can sell into China, it can change your business fortunes in a big way. That's why the U.S. cranberry industry has spent millions of dollars marketing in China over the past several years: to get people to try, and maybe even love, the little red fruit. ""At least not get [cranberries] confused with blueberries,"" said Lydia Lee, president of the public relations firm Weber Shandwick's China division. In 2013, Massachusetts-based Ocean Spray, which claims to supply 65% of the world's cranberries, hired the agency to help raise its profile in China. When the firm conducted a survey of Chinese consumers, more than 95% said they did not know what cranberries were.Beyond the staples of marketing, like trade shows and tasting events, Lee's team devised strategies that would become part of the company's China playbook: pushing the product on giant e-commerce sites like Alibaba, wining and dining editors from food and lifestyle publications, and even flying social media influencers out to a Massachusetts bog to experience the cranberry harvest in person. ""These influencers brought their own cameras and live-streamed the whole process to their followers,"" Lee said. ""And these followers, they were tweeting all about it because it was something very curious."" Lee's team also played up the cranberry's connection to Thanksgiving. In one promotional video produced for Ocean Spray, a young Chinese woman has Thanksgiving dinner with a Massachusetts family. Spliced in with shots of people cooking and eating were, of course, lots of images of cranberries being mixed into various dishes. ""The whole atmosphere of family gathering together, you know, having a feast, watching football ... kids running around, resonates very well with Chinese culture,"" Lee said. ""This is what we do in Chinese New Year."" In addition to Ocean Spray, there was another group trying to promote cranberries in China: a quasi-governmental agency called the Cranberry Marketing Committee. Since 2014, the U.S. group has spent roughly $1 million every year just on marketing in China. Some of that money has gone toward paying restaurants to put cranberry-themed dishes on the menu and hiring chefs to create recipes. All of these marketing efforts were heavily aimed at younger women from large cities like Beijing and Shanghai, a demographic that, according to Lee, is not only influential, but also open to trying new things — like a tart, shriveled, little-known fruit from the other side of the planet. So, did this multi-front marketing blitz actually work? The answer, according to U.S. export data, is a definite ""yes."" Between 2013 and 2018, sales of dried cranberries to China increased by over 1,000%. In 2018, China bought nearly $55 million worth of the fruit, making it that year's biggest spender on U.S. dried cranberries. A lot of those berries wind up in the typical places, like muffins or trail mix. But increasingly, sweetened dried cranberries have been popping up in some classic Chinese foods such as lù dòu gāo, a slightly sweet pastry made from mung beans. With exports soaring, it seemed the cranberry had finally taken root in China. Then, of course, the trade war happened. On July 6, 2018, the White House approved tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. Chinese trade authorities immediately retaliated with tariffs on dozens of U.S. goods, including dried cranberries, for which China's Ministry of Commerce raised an existing tariff from 15% to 40%. ""That's frustrating,"" said Brian Wick, executive director of the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers' Association. ""The metaphor that I have in my mind is the track meet. You're running your race ... you're building up speed and you're really doing good ... and then someone says, 'Well, let's drag some hurdles out now. You gotta jump over these hurdles.' "" How the trade war squeezes sales to China President Trump insists the trade war will eventually pay off for American agriculture. However, the latest export data show that many Chinese businesses have already cut off ties with their U.S. cranberry suppliers. About an hour's drive north of Shanghai, in the city of Taicang, there's a warehouse filled wall-to-wall with pallets of imported dried foods, including almonds, raisins, plums and blueberries. The warehouse belongs to Karat Farm, a company that buys fruit by the ton and divides it up for resale in China. Min Xiaoguang, Karat's general manager, who also goes by Greg Min, says the top-seller is dried cranberries. In a room down the hall, plastic bins full of dried cranberries are dumped into a big machine and funneled into little resealable bags that will end up in a baking aisle somewhere in China. On the front of each bag is a round American flag seal with the words ""Grown in the USA."" ""I think America's cranberry, the quality is the highest,"" Min says. But now that he's paying a 40% import tax, his profits have taken a hit. ""I just want the trade war [to] end quickly,"" Min said. ""I hope so. Otherwise, we have to choose another country's cranberry."" Although Min likes his current American supplier, he says it would be cheaper for him to buy from Canada or Chile, the two other major cranberry producers. A few miles away, in another part of Taicang, a snack manufacturer called Shanghai Bouquet Food Company has already made the switch. A few years ago, Bouquet launched its first cranberry-flavored treat: a nougat-like, Taiwanese-style cookie called a snowflake crisp, studded with dried cranberries. The product was a hit with customers, so the company launched more cranberry-based snacks: a cranberry shortbread cookie, dried cranberries with mixed nuts, and a cookie filled with a cranberry-mango paste. According to the company's purchasing manager, Dou Lin, Bouquet bought about 300 to 400 tons of dried cranberries from the U.S. last year. But this year? ""I'm ordering everything from Canada because the U.S. price is too high,"" she said. And a lot of other Chinese companies have made the same call. U.S. export data show cranberry sales to China during the first-half of 2019 were 45% lower than sales during first-half of 2018, before the Chinese tariffs on U.S. cranberries went into effect. That was after several years of continuous growth. ""The growth was not only halted, but it was also essentially reversed,"" said Terry Humfeld, executive director of a trade group called The Cranberry Institute. Humfeld said many growers have received payments from the USDA as part of a program to help farmers whose sales are being hurt by tariffs. This year the USDA gave the Cranberry Marketing Committee over $3 million to promote the fruit, not just in China, but also in other markets, such as India, where the cranberry is still relatively unknown. While the industry appreciates the help, Humfeld said, these are short-term fixes to a trade war that could do long-term damage. ""The longer this retaliatory tariff situation goes on, the more difficult and costly it's going to be to reverse that negative sales trend,"" he said. Dou of Bouquet Foods says she doesn't regret her decision to switch to Canadian berries. But she's also aware it may add to the difficulties that American cranberry growers are experiencing. ""It's really sad what's happening to the farmers,"" she said, ""because in this situation, there isn't much they can control.""",0
"Come June, there will be 18 fewer Kohl's stores across the U.S. On a conference call with investors after its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report Thursday, CEO Kevin Mansell acknowledged these planned store closures represent what is likely the first time in the company's 52-year history as a department store that it is closing multiple stores at a time. CFO Wes McDonald went on to say that Kohl's has only shuttered about five locations since he joined in 2003. Meanwhile, the Wisconsin-based retailer said that it will pilot a smaller, 35,000-square-foot Kohl's in seven U.S. markets, an additional two off-price stores and enter the outlet space with 12 Fila stores. Combined, these real estate experiments indicate Kohl's, whose revenues have stalled at roughly $19 billion over the past four years, is willing to explore new ways to boost its sales and profitability.Still, some analysts remain skeptical the retailer will be able to deliver on its financial targets, as it combats elevated inventories and an overall shift in spending away from department stores. ""Kohl's enters 2016 with high inventory in what has been a highly promotional and competitive retail sector,"" Citi analyst Paul Lejuez told investors. ""We expect pressure on sales and margins to continue.""The 18 stores that Kohl's will close this summer are expected to generate $55 million in savings, and represent less than 1 percent of its total sales. Mansell said these stores were selected due to their overall sales and momentum, their overhead cost and the amount of overlap they had with nearby stores. But the shift in strategy isn't limited to exiting underperforming locations. When considering the seven new small-format stores Kohl's intends to open this year, along with the two additional Off/Aisle stores and 12 Fila outlet stores it has planned, the chain's store count will actually increase by three. That represents more of a change in strategy as opposed to a broad-based approach to cutting costs. Long term, Mansell said it's too early to say what its store footprint will look like. Management plans to watch the performance of these new locations through the fall and holiday season — as well as see how much of its closed stores' sales transfer to nearby locations or online — before it can better determine what its portfolio will look like. ""As painful as it is to close stores, we applaud Kohl's for taking action that is necessary in order to compete more effectively in a more complex and challenging retail environment,"" Carter Harrison, an analyst at the Conlumino retail research firm, told investors. ""It is especially encouraging that such a move is only one part of a wider package of measures, many of which involve more positive steps to reinvigorate the company.""",0
"Frayser, a community in north Memphis, Tennessee, lies at the edge of a peninsula formed by two small rivers that merge into the Mississippi. Put on the map in the nineteenth century by the presence of a railway and propped up by the freight industry, the neighborhood blossomed into an archetypal middle-class American suburb by the 1950s. But in the subsequent decades, the decline of American manufacturing hit Frayser hard. Industry cratered and workers fled, seeking jobs elsewhere. Today, Frayser’s per-capita income is lower than nearly 99 percent of U.S. neighborhoods. And, 85 percent of the children living in the community qualify for free or reduced-price school lunches. Frayser isn’t wholly unique. Although the conventional wisdom is that the American economy is booming, many communities are being left behind. Known as financial deserts, these areas face entrenched structural barriers to development, including weak public transit and a dearth of affordable housing. Those who call them home also struggle to gain access to traditional banking services. The reason is two-fold: Financial services firms are less available in distressed communities and, where access does exist, residents there lack sufficient income to build up savings. Absent a checking or savings account, and as banks across the country are closing their branches, Americans who live at or near the poverty line are forced to use alternative financial services when they need urgent cash or a loan, including pawn shops, title lenders and payday lenders, which typically charge annual interest rates of around 400 percent—and sometimes much higher. In Frayser, these offerings outnumber actual banks at a ratio of 8-1. Across the country, nearly one in four adults have borrowed money from alternative financial institutions. The result is a cycle of debilitating debt that hinders families’ capacity to build a better life. (Article continued below.) However, innovative initiatives such as MassMutual’s Live Mutual Project are offering a sense of hope in financial deserts. Launched in December 2018, the Live Mutual Project is a comprehensive social impact program that connects community members to neighbors, resources and services in their neighborhoods to help navigate the oftentimes confusing and overwhelming environment meant to support residents. It is designed to help community members build a strong foundation for financial well-being today and for future generations by addressing the key issues that perpetuate cycles of poverty. The project is currently being piloted in two financially distraught neighborhoods, including Frayser. “So many organizations have financial literacy training and other support programs in place in these communities, but when offered in isolation they’re not as effective as they could be,” said Jennifer Halloran, head of brand at MassMutual who leads the Live Mutual Project. “So, we asked ourselves: How do we support people who are on the brink of being able to get into better economic shape in these financial deserts? How can we, as a company, leverage our financial resources and expertise, and maximize our intended positive impact?” Dispatches from the desert Despite the relative growth of the U.S. economy as a whole over the past few years, many Americans are still struggling. According to one study, 78 percent of U.S. workers live paycheck to paycheck. For those in poorer communities, a stark absence of banks or credit unions only compounds their challenges. Owning property or starting a small business simply isn’t viable for the 16 million adults who don’t even have a bank account. Many of these residents also don’t have access to conventional financial literacy resources. “I think we assume that people have basic financial literacy skills, such as the ability to create a budget,” said Annamaria Lusardi, the endowed chair of economics and accountancy at the George Washington University School of Business. “But we don’t teach this anywhere, so how do people figure it out?” The lack of financial resources only exacerbates socioeconomic challenges in some of America’s most underserved communities. Take the North End neighborhood in Springfield, Massachusetts—the city that MassMutual has called home since its founding in 1851. The community, which hosts the organization’s second pilot program, has no bank and just a single ATM that runs out of cash daily. Jobs are hard to come by. At a time when the U.S. national average unemployment rate is just 3.8 percent, unemployment in some parts of the North End reaches 31 percent. (Article continued below.)But statistics only offer a bird’s eye view of the situation. To understand what’s happening on the ground in this financial desert, one of the Live Mutual Project’s nonprofit partners, New North Citizens’ Council, brings together local representatives to discuss community challenges. These personal reports have given the Live Mutual Project team an invaluable perspective on the real conditions in the North End. One insight that came from these meetings was that funerals were a significant source of financial strife. Sometimes families are unable to raise enough money even to get a body released from the hospital. In response, the Live Mutual Project is bringing together the hospital, funeral home and New North Citizens’ Council to find solutions that will enable residents to deal with the financial challenge of losing loved ones without resorting to payday loans. This in-the-trenches strategy developed from an organizational ethos that prizes working collaboratively with the community it aims to serve, said Dennis Duquette, president of the MassMutual Foundation. “We engage with the community, we listen, we build trust, and we act,” he noted. “Rather than come in and say, ‘Well, we’re MassMutual, and we know what the problem is. You need to do X, Y, and Z,’ we’re really taking more of a community-organizing approach.” Designing community-specific solutions Part of why the Live Mutual Project rolled out its initiatives in just two financial deserts is because its effectiveness depends on specificity. Duquette stresses that, because each community faces unique socioeconomic challenges, top-down solutions conceived in a boardroom and replicated across the country simply won’t work. You need an approach that’s informed by local perspectives and tailored to each area. When the Live Mutual Project examined the financial landscape in Frayser, they realized they could start by helping the community in two mutually reinforcing ways. The first way was to offer funding to local organizations already doing important work, such as RISE, a nonprofit that offers a savings incentive program coupled with basic financial literacy coaching. The second way was to have MassMutual Foundation leverage its networks in Memphis to encourage local groups to work together to support their common cause. “[Frayser] is a place where there are several strong organizations, but they don’t have clearly defined shared goals or capacity to take time away from daily programming to work on strategic partnerships,” explained Halloran. “When you make these connections and bring them together, you give them that forum for success. They just become stronger and more sustainable.” While they’re still in early stages, Duquette said that the pilot programs underway in Frayser and the North End of Springfield have already yielded positive results. In short, the Live Mutual Project’s hands-on, customized tactics are working. “The paradigm of good corporate citizens as check writers just doesn’t fly anymore,” Duquette said. “We believe a collaborative assault on poverty, blending the wisdom and resiliency of the community residents with the unique strengths of corporate, non-profit, and public sector partners can and will yield creative, sustainable solutions. It’s a somewhat provocative approach, but we’re very encouraged, hopeful and excited by what we’re seeing already.”",0
"(CNN)House Democrats are preparing a flurry of subpoenas in the face of the Trump administration's stonewalling of their impeachment investigation, amid a new debate within their caucus over holding a vote to formally authorize the inquiry in order to call the White House's bluff, according to Democratic sources. In the face of the blistering White House letter refusing to cooperate with their probe, Democrats expect they are likely done with any voluntary interviews for most witnesses, according to multiple Democratic sources. And Democrats are now threatening subpoenas to associates of Rudy Giuliani and considering them for current State Department officials, including former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. She is scheduled for an interview Friday, but there are new concerns she won't appear given that she is still a State Department employee and could face backlash internally if she were to appear voluntarily. Discussions about Yovanovitch's testimony continued into Wednesday, and it remained unclear how it would it shake out by Friday. An official working on the impeachment inquiry said the committees, at the moment, expect Yovanovitch to appear Friday. On Monday, Fiona Hill, President Donald Trump's top Russia adviser until she left the administration in August, will be interviewed behind closed doors by three House panels as part of the Democrats' impeachment probe, according to a source familiar with the matter. Since Hill has left the administration she presumably will be freer to speak to the committees, much the way former US Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker was when he testified last week. Negotiations are also intensifying over bringing in for an interview the whistleblower whose complaint has upended Trump's presidency, with new discussions about holding the interview in secret or off site and not disclosing that it happened until after the fact, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation. At the same time, a small but influential group of Democrats privately and publicly tell CNN that it makes sense to hold an impeachment inquiry vote -- something House Republicans have demanded -- arguing it would derail the White House's declaration that the impeachment inquiry is ""invalid"" because there's been no House vote formally authorizing the probe. A respected voice within the caucus told CNN Wednesday that it makes sense to hold a vote imminently. ""I think it's time for us to put a vote on the floor, a resolution for the inquiry structured in such a way that it can move forward with full power of the Congress behind it,"" said Rep. John Garamendi, a California Democrat. ""They want to fight, OK, let's arm ourselves completely and totally with the full power of Congress. The votes, I am sure, are there for an impeachment inquiry, structured in such a way we have the full opportunity to get all the information, call in the witnesses, get the details, get the emails and all the rest."" But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is still resisting calls for a vote -- with her allies arguing it is not required under House rules or the Constitution, while contending a vote in the full chamber would do little to change the Trump administration's posture toward the investigation. The uptick in conversations underscores the crucial moment Democrats find themselves in during their impeachment push. There is growing pressure to vote on impeaching Trump as soon as Thanksgiving, but at the same time House Democratic leaders want to appear to be methodically collecting evidence over what they view as an abuse of power by the President in urging the Ukrainian government to investigate his potential political rival, Joe Biden, at the same time as US aid to the country had been stalled. The White House's stonewalling presents a new challenge to their efforts to gather evidence but Democrats say defying subpoenas could also bolster their case that Trump is obstructing Congress, an impeachable offense. A number of Democrats believe that if they hold a vote to formally authorize an impeachment inquiry and the White House continues to defy their demands, it will make it even easier to convince the public that Trump should be impeached. Looking ahead The prospect of voting on an impeachment inquiry will be a key topic of conversation next week when House Democrats return from Congress' two-week recess. The caucus is expected to have a number of meetings throughout the week to get on the same page in confronting the White House's offensive against their investigation. House Democratic leaders will hold a conference call this Friday, where the impeachment debate is likely to come up. Moreover, Democrats plan to soon take up legislation, offered by Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, that would in part require disclosure of offers of campaign assistance from foreign governments. Yet the debate over next steps will continue. In particular, Garamendi's comments resonated with some Democratic members and aides, who said it's time to put the White House back on the defensive. A senior Democratic aide involved in strategy discussions, who asked not to be identified, said there's been no official change in the House Democratic leadership's posture against holding a vote at this time, but added: ""There is no reason we shouldn't call their bluff. The votes are there. Some moderates may not want to take a vote, but they are there."" Another Democratic member on a committee leading the impeachment charge said: ""I think John is probably correct. POTUS is pushing us to the point, and we will see next week when folks get back on our measured approach."" A Democratic aide familiar with ongoing conversations told CNN that rank-and-file members pushing for it could be enough to convince leaders to hold a floor vote authorizing the probe. The White House's letter to Pelosi called the impeachment investigation an illegitimate effort to ""overturn the results of the 2016 election,"" and all but dared Democrats to formally vote on it, although it did not actually demand such a vote. But Pelosi has not yet backed off her opposition to holding a formal vote, saying they already are conducting an impeachment probe that is valid under House rules. She has several reasons to resist a vote: It would eat up valuable time on the floor, it would be a politically difficult vote for some moderate Democrats and it would give Republicans a new avenue to criticize Democrats if they didn't give the minority subpoena power, which was granted in past presidential impeachment proceedings. Pelosi is also cognizant of the different political pressures facing some of her members -- most notably the 31 Democrats and represent districts Trump carried in 2016, some of whom are the most vulnerable in their caucus. While many have publicly backed an impeachment inquiry, voting on a resolution authorizing the probe could put them in a difficult spot. One congressional aide familiar with moderate Democrats' thinking said that a narrowly focused impeachment inquiry vote would be less of an issue, given how many moderates have already publicly supported an inquiry into the President's actions on Ukraine. But authorizing a broader scope for the impeachment investigation, the aide warned, could put members in a tougher position. Asked for comment, Pelosi's office pointed to her recent remarks on the issue. ""If we want to do it, we'll do it. If we don't, we don't,"" Pelosi told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's editorial board last week. ""But we're certainly not going to do it because of the President."" White House officials declined to say Tuesday how much Trump would be willing to provide if a successful vote were in fact held. Shift in stonewalling strategy The White House's stance that it will not comply with any Democratic requests in the impeachment inquiry complicates Democrats' efforts to quickly obtain the investigative materials they're seeking surrounding Trump's push for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political opponent. But if the Trump administration defies Democratic subpoenas and prevents witnesses from appearing, Democrats don't believe that will ultimately slow down their efforts. Unlike the House Judiciary Committee's investigation into obstruction of justice, where the panel went to court to try to obtain grand jury material and witness testimony, Democrats are unlikely to use the courts to try to enforce their newest subpoenas, as that process can drag out for months. That's because Democrats think as though they have the material they need already: the whistleblower complaint, the transcript of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky and text messages showing there was a connection between Zelensky opening an investigation and Ukraine's desire for a one-on-one meeting. ""You know what you need to know from the documents that we already have,"" said Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Virginia Democrat. ""It is why I think the stonewalling is counterproductive and ultimately futile. There are going to be more people coming forward irrespective of White House stonewalling. All it does is persuade the public ... (the President) is resisting for a reason."" The White House stonewalling of the investigation could become wrapped up in the articles of impeachment that are drafted as obstruction of Congress. ""The White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the President's abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction,"" Pelosi said Tuesday in a statement responding to the White House letter. The three committees now leading the impeachment probe -- Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight -- have already issued subpoenas to the White House, State Department, Office of Management and Budget and Pentagon as part of the investigation. They've also subpoenaed Giuliani and US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, who was directed by the State Department not to attend a scheduled deposition on Tuesday. More subpoenas are likely on the way soon. In addition to Yovanovitch, Democrats have requested documents from and interviews with Giuliani associates Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman and Semyon ""Sam"" Kislin. Democrats have warned subpoenas could be issued soon if the three do not comply voluntarily. Democrats have also sought testimony from two additional State Department officials in connection with Ukraine and the July phone call, and they have requested documents from Vice President Mike Pence as part of the inquiry. While Democrats aren't counting on cooperation from the Trump administration, a key witness they want to hear from as they gather evidence is the whistleblower, who set the impeachment investigation in motion by filing a complaint with allegations that Trump sought Ukraine's help investigating his political opponent and the White House tried to cover it up. The timing of that meeting remains unclear, but sources told CNN that there are discussions about interviewing the whistleblower in secret with certain members of the House Intelligence Committee in an effort to protect the whistleblower's anonymity. Various options are being considered, including bringing the witness into a secure facility in the Capitol through passages that are off limits to the press. Holding the meeting off-site is also being discussed. Regardless of how it happens, that testimony is likely to be a key step before Democrats proceed with drafting articles of impeachment.

"Many are mourning the passing of Baltimore native Rep. Elijah Cummings, who died at the age of 68 early Thursday morning. The Maryland Democrat died at Gilchrist Hospice Care, which is affiliated with Johns Hopkins Hospital, around 2:30 a.m. EDT from “complications concerning longstanding health challenges,” his office confirmed in a statement. He underwent a medical procedure in September that caused him to miss a high-profile hearing on Washington, D.C., statehood and kept him away from the House Oversight and Reform Committee, which he chairs. In a statement to the Baltimore Sun, Cummings initially predicted he would be back after a week, then extended that timeline when the newspaper asked a week later. “I am recovering following my medical procedure and remain in constant communication with my staff and my colleagues in the Congress,” Cummings said in a statement to the paper Sept. 30. “My doctors anticipate that I will be returning to Washington, D.C., when the House comes back into session in two weeks.” His office declined to comment about the procedure in September. The congressman has had health problems in recent years, causing him to use a wheelchair and a walker. According to the Baltimore Sun, he underwent a minimally invasive heart procedure in 2017 that led to an infection. He was also hospitalized for a knee infection. His wife Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, chairwoman of the Maryland Democratic Party, said in a statement Thursday that her husband was an honorable man who served his district with “dignity, integrity, compassion and humility.” “He worked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity and that our nation’s diversity was our promise, not our problem. It has been an honor to walk by his side on this incredible journey. I loved him deeply and will miss him dearly,"" she said.",0
"Elijah Cummings, the longtime Baltimore congressman, died early Thursday, October 17, at the age of 68, his office said. Cummings passed away at Gilchrist Hospice Care, a Johns Hopkins affiliate, at 2:45 a.m. from ""complications concerning longstanding health challenges,"" his office said. Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, the chairwoman of the Maryland Democratic Party and Cummings' wife, said in a statement that Cummings was ""an honorable man who proudly served his district and the nation with dignity, integrity, compassion and humility."" ""He worked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity and that our nation's diversity was our promise, not our problem,"" Rockeymoore Cummings said. ""I loved him deeply and will miss him dearly."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered the flags at the Capitol to be flown at half staff in his memory. The White House, too, lowered its flag. In her weekly press conference on Thursday, Pelosi said she was ""devastated by the loss"" of Cummings, who she referred to as ""the North Star"" of the House. She said she may rename a bill to lower prescription drug costs in his honor. ""He was not just a great congressman, he was a great man,"" House Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on MSNBC Thursday morning. On Thursday, Cummings will lie in state in National Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol, according to Pelosi. There will be a formal ceremony Thursday morning that will be open to lawmakers, Cummings' family and invited guests. The public viewing will take place after the memorial service. Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. Young said in a statement that ""people throughout the world have lost a powerful voice and one of the strongest and most gifted crusaders for social justice."" Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, said in a statement that ""Congressman Cummings leaves behind an incredible legacy of fighting for Baltimore City and working to improve people's lives. He was a passionate and dedicated public servant whose countless contributions made our state and our country better."" President Trump praised Cummings' ""strength, passion and wisdom"" in a tweet, despite the insults he hurled at Cummings this summer. ""My warmest condolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings. I got to see first hand the strength, passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard, if not impossible, to replace!"" the president tweeted shortly before 9 a.m. The House Oversight and Reform Committee chairman, a Democrat and 23-year House veteran, was a key figure in the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump and a recent target of intense criticism from the president. Cummings missed two roll call votes Thursday, the first day back following a two-week House recess. He hadn't returned to work after having a medical procedure that he said would only keep him away for about a week, The Baltimore Sun noted. He previously released a statement saying he'd be back by the time the session resumed. He hadn't taken part in a roll call vote since September 11. He hadn't returned to work after having a medical procedure that he said would only keep him away for about a week, The Baltimore Sun noted. The procedure already caused Cummings to miss a September hearing on Washington, D.C., statehood. The statement didn't detail the procedure. He previously was treated for heart and knee issues. Cummings' Humble beginnings A sharecropper's son, Cummings was a formidable orator who passionately advocated for the poor in his black-majority district, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore as well as more well-to-do suburbs. As chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, Cummings led multiple investigations of Mr. Trump's dealings, including probes in 2019 relating to the president's family members serving in the White House. The president responded by criticizing Cummings' district as a ""rodent-infested mess"" where ""no human being would want to live."" The comments came weeks after Mr. Trump drew bipartisan condemnation following his calls for Democratic congresswomen of color to get out of the U.S. ""right now"" and go back to their ""broken and crime-infested countries."" Cummings replied that government officials must stop making ""hateful, incendiary comments"" that only serve to divide and distract the nation from its real problems, including mass shootings and white supremacy. ""Those in the highest levels of the government must stop invoking fear, using racist language and encouraging reprehensible behavior,"" Cummings said in a speech at the National Press Club. Cummings told the Baltimore Sun that he had only spoken to Mr. Trump one-on-one once, in 2017. Cummings recalled saying: ""Mr. President, you're now 70-something, I'm 60-something. Very soon you and I will be dancing with the angels. The thing that you and I need to do is figure out what we can do — what present can we bring to generations unborn?"" Working way up Cummings' career spanned decades in Maryland politics. He rose through the ranks of the Maryland House of Delegates before winning his congressional seat in a special election in 1996 to replace former Representative Kweisi Mfume, who left the seat to lead the NAACP. Cummings continued his rise in Congress. In 2016, he was the senior Democrat on the House Benghazi Committee, which he said was ""nothing more than a taxpayer-funded effort to bring harm to Hillary Clinton's campaign"" for president. Cummings was an early supporter of Barack Obama's presidential bid in 2008. Throughout his career, Cummings used his fiery voice to highlight the struggles and needs of inner-city residents. He was a firm believer in some much-debated approaches to help the poor and addicted, such as needle exchange programs as a way to reduce the spread of AIDS. Cummings was very popular in his district, where he was a key member of the community. Cummings said in an interview with ""60 Minutes"" in January that he was one of the few members of Congress who lived in an inner city environment. ""I like to be among my constituents. Let me tell you something man, if I don't do well in this block I'm in trouble. I mean, if you wanna take a poll, if I lost in this block I might as well go – I might as well stay home,"" Cummings said in the interview. Cummings was born on Jan. 18, 1951. In grade school, a counselor told Cummings he was too slow to learn and spoke poorly and he would never fulfill his dream of becoming a lawyer. ""I was devastated,"" Cummings told The Associated Press in 1996, shortly before he won his seat in Congress. ""My whole life changed. I became very determined."" It steeled Cummings to prove that counselor wrong. He became not only a lawyer, but one of the most powerful orators in the Maryland House of Delegates, where he entered office in 1983. He rose to become House speaker pro tem, the first black delegate to hold the position. He would begin his comments slowly, developing his theme and raising the emotional heat until it became like a sermon from the pulpit. Cummings was quick to note the differences between Congress and the Maryland General Assembly, which has long been controlled by Democrats. ""After coming from the state where, basically, you had a lot of people working together, it's clear that the lines are drawn here,"" Cummings said about a month after entering office in Washington in 1996. Cummings chaired the Congressional Black Caucus from 2003 to 2004, employing a hard-charging, explore-every-option style to put the group in the national spotlight. He cruised to big victories in the overwhelmingly Democratic district, which had given Maryland its first black congressman in 1970 when Parren Mitchell was elected. Cummings addressed his recent health issues in the January interview with ""60 Minutes."" ""Like I tell my constituents, ""Don't get it twisted. You know, I may – my knee may be hurtin' a little bit, but my mind is clear. My mission is clear."" And I am prepared and able to do what I have to do. And I will do it to the very best of my ability, so help me God,"" Cummings said. What happens now? According to The Baltimore Sun, Cummings' seat will remain vacant until a special election is held. Hogan, the state's Republican governor, has 10 days to officially call for the special election, which will take place no earlier than 65 days after that, which would be late February. Hogan's spokesman, Mike Ricci, expressed uncertainty to The Sun on Thursday morning about when the special election would happen. As for Cummings' role on the House Oversight committee, Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York will fill in as acting chair until Democrats choose a permanent leader. The timing for when that will happen is unclear, according to a senior Democratic leadership aide who spoke to The Sun on condition of anonymity.",0
"WASHINGTON — Republicans have sought for weeks amid the impeachment inquiry to shift attention to President Trump’s demands that Ukraine investigate any 2016 election meddling, defending it as a legitimate concern while Democrats accuse Mr. Trump of pursuing fringe theories for his benefit. The Republican defense of Mr. Trump became central to the impeachment proceedings when Fiona Hill, a respected Russia scholar and former senior White House official, added a harsh critique during testimony on Thursday. She told some of Mr. Trump’s fiercest defenders in Congress that they were repeating “a fictional narrative.” She said that it likely came from a disinformation campaign by Russian security services, which also propagated it. In a briefing that closely aligned with Dr. Hill’s testimony, American intelligence officials informed senators and their aides in recent weeks that Russia had engaged in a yearslong campaign to essentially frame Ukraine as responsible for Moscow’s own hacking of the 2016 election, according to three American officials. The briefing came as Republicans stepped up their defenses of Mr. Trump in the Ukraine affair. The revelations demonstrate Russia’s persistence in trying to sow discord among its adversaries — and show that the Kremlin apparently succeeded, as unfounded claims about Ukrainian interference seeped into Republican talking points. American intelligence agencies believe Moscow is likely to redouble its efforts as the 2020 presidential campaign intensifies. The classified briefing for senators also focused on Russia’s evolving influence tactics, including its growing ability to better disguise operations. Russia has engaged in a “long pattern of deflection” to pin blame for its malevolent acts on other countries, Dr. Hill said, not least Ukraine, a former Soviet republic. Since Ukraine won independence in 1991, Russia has tried to reassert influence there, meddling in its politics, maligning pro-Western leaders and accusing Ukrainian critics of Moscow of fascist leanings. “The Russians have a particular vested interest in putting Ukraine, Ukrainian leaders in a very bad light,” she told lawmakers. But the campaign by Russian intelligence in recent years has been even more complex as Moscow tries not only to undermine the government in Kyiv but also to use a disinformation campaign there to influence the American political debate. The accusations of a Ukrainian influence campaign center on actions by a handful of Ukrainians who openly criticized or sought to damage Mr. Trump’s candidacy in 2016. They were scattershot efforts that were far from a replica of Moscow’s interference, when President Vladimir V. Putin ordered military and intelligence operatives to mount a broad campaign to sabotage the American election. The Russians in 2016 conducted covert operations to hack Democratic computers and to use social media to exploit divisions among Americans. This time, Russian intelligence operatives deployed a network of agents to blame Ukraine for its 2016 interference. Starting at least in 2017, the operatives peddled a mixture of now-debunked conspiracy theories along with established facts to leave an impression that the government in Kyiv, not Moscow, was responsible for the hackings of Democrats and its other interference efforts in 2016, senior intelligence officials said. The Russian intelligence officers conveyed the information to prominent Russians and Ukrainians who then used a range of intermediaries, like oligarchs, businessmen and their associates, to pass the material to American political figures and even some journalists, who were likely unaware of its origin, the officials said. That muddy brew worked its way into American information ecosystems, sloshing around until parts of it reached Mr. Trump, who has also spoken with Mr. Putin about allegations of Ukrainian interference. Mr. Trump also brought up the assertions of Ukrainian meddling in his July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, which is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry into whether he abused his power by asking for a public commitment to investigations he stood to gain from personally.Mr. Trump referred elliptically to allegations that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election and brought up a related conspiracy theory. Asking Mr. Zelensky to “do us a favor,” Mr. Trump added, “I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine.” Russia’s operation to blame Ukraine has become more relevant as Republicans have tried to focus public debate during the impeachment inquiry on any Ukrainian role in the 2016 campaign, American officials said. Republicans have denounced any suggestion that their concerns about Ukrainian meddling are without merit or that they are ignoring Russia’s broader interference. “Not a single Republican member of this committee said Russia did not meddle in the 2016 elections,” Representative Elise Stefanik, Republican of New York, said Thursday. Indeed, Ms. Stefanik and her Republican colleagues on the Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee, which is conducting the impeachment hearing, have also steered clear of the fringe notion that Mr. Trump mentioned to Mr. Zelensky, which is pushed by Russian intelligence: the so-called CrowdStrike server conspiracy theory, which falsely suggests Ukraine, not Russia, was behind the breach of Democratic operatives’ servers. Mr. Trump repeated the baseless claim on Friday in an interview with “Fox & Friends,” laying out the narrative and doubling down after a host gently pressed him on whether he was sure of one aspect of the debunked theory, that the F.B.I. gave a Democratic server to what Mr. Trump had inaccurately described as a Ukrainian-owned company. “That is what the word is,” Mr. Trump replied. Some Republicans have also focused on Hunter Biden, raising questions about whether his hiring by the Ukrainian energy company Burisma was corrupt. Burisma hired Mr. Biden while his father, former Vice President Joseph Biden Jr., a potential rival of Mr. Trump’s in the 2020 election, was leading the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy. On the July 25 call, Mr. Trump also demanded Mr. Zelensky investigate Burisma and Hunter Biden. Moscow has long used its intelligence agencies and propaganda machine to muddy the waters of public debate, casting doubts over established facts. In her testimony, Dr. Hill noted Russia’s pattern of trying to blame other countries for its own actions, like the attempted poisoning last year of a former Russian intelligence officer or the downing of a passenger jet over Ukraine in 2014. Moscow’s goal is to cast doubt on established facts, said current and former officials. “The strategy is simply to create the impression that it is not really possible to know who was really behind it,” said Laura Rosenberger, the director of the Alliance for Securing Democracy, which tracks Russian disinformation efforts. Although American intelligence agencies have made no formal classified assessment about the Russian disinformation campaign against Ukraine, officials at several of the agencies have broadly agreed for some time that Russian intelligence services have embraced tactics to shift responsibility for the 2016 interference campaign away from themselves, officials said. Russia has relentlessly tried to deflect attention since the allegations of its interference campaign in the 2016 election first surfaced, one official said. Mr. Putin began publicly pushing false theories of Ukrainian interference in the early months of 2017 to deflect responsibility from Russia, said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine and a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who declined to answer questions about the briefing. “These people are pros at this,” said Mr. King, who caucuses with the Democrats. “The Soviet Union used disinformation for 70 years. This is nothing new. Vladimir Putin is a former K.G.B. agent. He is trained in deception. This is his stock and trade and he is doing it well.” During a news conference in February 2017, Mr. Putin accused the Ukrainian government of supporting Hillary Clinton during the previous American election and funding her candidacy with friendly oligarchs. It is not clear when American intelligence agencies learned about Moscow’s campaign or when precisely it began. Russian intelligence officers aimed part of their operation at prompting the Ukrainian authorities to investigate the allegations that people in Ukraine tried to tamper with the 2016 American election and to shut down inquiries into corruption by pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, according to a former official. One target was the leak of a secret ledger disclosed by a Ukrainian law enforcement agency that appeared to show that Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s onetime campaign chairman, had taken illicit payments from Ukrainian politicians who were close to Moscow. He was forced to step down from the Trump campaign after the ledger became public in August 2016, and the Russians have since been eager to cast doubt on its authenticity, the former official said. Intelligence officials believe that one of the people the Kremlin relied on to spread disinformation about Ukrainian interference was Oleg V. Deripaska, a Russian oligarch who had ties to Mr. Manafort. After his ouster from the campaign, Mr. Manafort told his former deputy later in 2016 that Ukrainians, not Russians, stole Democratic emails. Mr. Deripaska has broadly denied any role in election meddling. “There is a long history of Russians putting out fake information,” said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former senior C.I.A. official. “Now they are trying to put out theories that they think are damaging to the United States.”",1

"New York (CNN)Donald Trump's political tragedy is that he really does believe the call with Ukraine's President was ""perfect,"" though it may yet doom him with the stain of impeachment. The heavy-handed and characteristic blend of implied pressure and hinted-at quid pro quos that Trump deployed in the conversation -- that he first perfected as a real estate shark and then took to the White House -- now threatens to work against him. On stage at a New York news conference Wednesday, Trump, offered moral support by his Cabinet lieutenants Mike Pompeo and Steven Mnuchin, seemed embittered, lonely and a little confused. The behavior that he has always trusted to help him come out on top, with its obfuscation, bullying, fact-bending and conspiracy spinning tangents, suddenly didn't seem to be working. It was the same story for Rudy Giuliani, whose unchained appearances on television that Trump so prizes seemed to dig the President in deeper. And in the latest blockbuster revelation, a whistleblower complaint on Trump and Ukraine released Thursday morning accused the President of using his power ""to solicit interference from a foreign country"" in the 2020 election. White House officials, the whistleblower said, were ""deeply disturbed"" by Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. The officials attempted to ""lock down"" all records of the phone call, especially the word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced by the White House, the complaint states. There has long been a gap between Trump's conduct and the conventions of the office of the presidency. His success with his supporters has often rested in his willingness to so publicly flout such standards. But now it appears, that his unorthodox methods may have caught up with him. Many observers, like fired former FBI Director James Comey, have noted that Trump's way of doing business and demands for loyalty have similarities with the loaded language of a mafia don. The President's jailed former lawyer Michael Cohen was familiar with the approach Trump exhibited in his dealings with Ukraine. ""He doesn't give you questions, he doesn't give you orders, he speaks in a code. And I understand the code, because I've been around him for a decade,"" Cohen said in congressional testimony in February. But finally Trump, an expert on creating his own reality, may have been undone by facts on a page that he released himself, handing Democrats a clear, apparently prosecutable case, that suggests abuse of power with the transcript of the call with Zelensky. Trump is in new territory now. Building blocks of impeachment Wednesday was another tempestuous day in Washington, where an impeachment drive picked up stunning speed, and in the city where Trump made his legend and desperately fought to save it. It started with growing suspicions that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi got too far over her skis by launching impeachment hearings on Tuesday before seeing the call transcript or details of a whistleblower complaint on the same issue against Trump. But it ended with Democrats increasingly convinced they had the building blocks of a case against the President -- one that will pitch the nation into a long, dark political tunnel. Looking back, it now seems impossible that the President thought releasing the transcript would get him out of his jam. While it did not contain the direct quid pro quo of a threat to halt military aid unless Zelensky launched a probe against Joe Biden, it came perilously close to one. The distasteful spectacle of a President of a democratic superpower leaning on the rookie leader of a vulnerable post-Soviet state leaped off the page. Trump had long been scheduled to meet Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. In the light of events, their photo-op took on a surreal turn. Zelensky made sure to supply the soundbite that Trump had hoped for. ""There was no pressure,"" he said, before the US leader quickly jumped in to make sure no one missed the moment. ""You know there was no pressure,"" he said, turning to reporters. ""I appreciate the answer."" In a news conference punctuated by angry swipes at reporters later on, the President didn't have a very organized defense, suggesting that his underpowered White House may struggle to prepare him for the grueling impeachment saga to come. He claimed that his request for Zelensky to investigate Biden -- that appears to signal an abuse of power -- was no different than previous US pressure on Ukraine. Yet warnings that aid would be withheld if Kiev failed to improve its governance and fight corruption — made by several US senators and former Vice President Joe Biden -- are hardly in the same league as making a similar threat in the hope of getting dirt on a political foe. Trump also tried to argue that he'd been courteous with Zelensky -- and the transcript did show the avuncular nature that the President sometimes adopts. At another point, he offered testimony from an ally. ""You folks were saying such lies. Such horrible things about a call that was so innocent and so nice,"" Trump told reporters. ""In fact, (South Carolina Republican Sen.) Lindsey Graham said to me when he read it ... he said 'I can't believe it. I never knew you could be so nice.'"" ""I was nice. I'm nice to a lot of people. People don't understand that. But I was,"" Trump said, for once sounding vulnerable and upset that he's been misunderstood. He went on a Twitter offensive Thursday morning, painting himself as a victim and sharing op-eds and views of conservative allies rushing to his defense. ""THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!"" he tweeted at one point. Repeated pressure But the call transcript showed that Trump repeatedly pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. Trump also asked the Ukrainian leader to work with his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and US Attorney General William Barr on the issue, the call transcript reveals. Initially the impact of the call was to expose the normal partisan fault lines. Democrats declared it a smoking gun and Republicans accused Pelosi of moving without evidence. It was a classic Trump era scenario wherein a person's eyes told them the story their political standpoint required. Yet there was just enough concern and uncertainty on Capitol Hill -- especially after the arrival of a classified version of the whistleblower report -- to suggest that this is one scrape from which Trump won't skip free by sparking a new controversy to hijack the news cycle. ""There's obviously some very troubling things here,"" Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse told reporters on Wednesday night, calling for the kind of sober deliberation that a Congress torn by the nation's political divides rarely exhibits. ""Republicans ought not just circle the wagons and Democrats ought not be using words like 'impeach' before they knew anything about the actual substance,"" he said. Democrats have now gone so far down the road of impeachment that it seems unlikely they will be able to turn back. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said that the public evidence so far is ""as damning as you can imagine."" Trump's rock solid support among Republicans means that even if some GOP senators waver, the two-third majority needed to convict a President impeached by the House will be elusive. Yet the President's demeanor -- so different than his usual relentless combative public image -- was enough for pundits, some of whom suggest he has all along wanted to be impeached. Trump will surely come out fighting and he will never give up. But Wednesday's events left a strong impression that he neither wants the agony that is to come nor is fully prepared for it.",1
"Washington (CNN)Energy Secretary Rick Perry ""supported and encouraged"" President Donald Trump in July to speak to the newly-elected Ukrainian President, but on energy matters, the Energy Department said Sunday. Energy issues were not discussed during the July 25 phone conversation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to a rough transcript of the call released by the White House. That call has become a key focus of House Democrats' impeachment inquiry into Trump. ""Secretary Perry absolutely supported and encouraged the President to speak to the new President of Ukraine to discuss matters related to their energy security and economic development. He continues to believe that there is significant need for improved regional energy security -- which is exactly why he is heading to Lithuania tonight to meet with nearly two dozen European energy leaders (including Ukraine) on these issues,"" Energy Department spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said in a statement. The White House-released transcript of the call revealed Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Joe Biden and the activities of the former vice president's son, Hunter, who had been on a board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. There is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden. A separate whistleblower complaint alleged the President abused his official powers ""to solicit interference"" from Ukraine in the upcoming 2020 election, and that the White House took steps to cover it up. Trump has denied doing anything improper. Trump told House Republicans on a conference call Friday that Perry had urged him to make the call to Ukraine to discuss a liquified natural gas project, The Washington Post reported Sunday, citing three federal officials. Axios initially reported the details of Trump's comments on the Republican conference call on Saturday. CNN previously reported that some text messages released by former US Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker showed that Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani was working to set up the July call with Zelensky. Those texts also show that several other US diplomats, including Volker, were working to arrange the conversation. Trump's reported comments come as House Democrats have widened their impeachment inquiry into Trump, subpoenaing the White House on Friday for documents related to their investigation -- a move dubbed ""wasted time"" by the White House -- and requesting documents from Vice President Mike Pence. The New York Times and the Post also reported Friday that Perry plans to leave his post by December, though no official announcement has been made. Perry has been described by some as being a key component of the US' relationship with Ukraine because of the energy component. The secretary led the US delegation to Zelensky's inauguration in May and and was one of what one official called the ""three amigos"" leading US relations with the country, having met at least three times with Zelensky. In an interview with CBN News on Friday, Perry said, ""as God is my witness,"" that neither Joe or Hunter Biden's name came up during conversations he had with Zelensky. ""I never heard, and I talked to the President about this, I had a conversation with -- a phone call -- with Rudy Giuliani about it. I've talked to the previous ambassador. I've talked to the current ambassador. I've talked to Kurt Volker, Gordan Sondland, the EU ambassador -- every name that you've seen out in the media and not once, not once as God as my witness, not once was a Biden name -- not the former vice president, not his son ever mentioned,"" Perry said. He added: ""Corruption was talked about in the country but it was always a relatively vague term of, you know, the oligarchs and this and that and what have you."" Perry is also scheduled to meet with Ukrainian officials this coming week ""to develop enhanced interconnections between Poland and Ukraine,"" the department announced Friday. CNN's Jim Acosta, Jeremy Diamond, Greg Wallace, Adam Levine contributed to this report. ",0
" (CNN)Dear President Trump, For many years you've been telling us you're the master of the deal. Well, now is the time to make the deal of your life. It's time to negotiate your resignation. We know you'll drive a hard bargain, but people are exhausted, and there's a good chance they'd cut you a good deal just to put an end to this chapter. The number of Americans supporting your removal from office is climbing fast. Many would probably welcome your departure. Isn't this the best moment to bargain? Almost three years since your election, most Americans haven't been convinced of your greatness, no matter how often you proclaim it. Still, right now you could possibly negotiate immunity for all the crimes you may or may not have committed as president, in exchange for returning to private life. Your former Trump organization vice president, Barbara Res, says she thinks you might resign rather than face possible removal from office. Who would want to end the presidency by forcible removal? That would be a true disgrace -- one of your favorite words. Instead, you could walk out on your own terms and get back to your first love: real estate. You could declare that Americans simply don't deserve you, that it was the country's fault. You can blame the deep state if you want. Say you don't want to waste your valuable time in a divisive impeachment process -- then blame the Democrats. If you're a really good negotiator, you might be able to sign an immunity agreement guaranteeing that you won't be prosecuted. Then you will admit to nothing and say that you stepped down selflessly, to spare the country. In that case, history might be more inclined to consider your version of the story. You've told us that being president is costing you a fortune, as much as $5 billion. The experts say that figure is absurd, but what do they know? Haven't you already lost enough — money, time, dignity? Imagine all that you would gain by leaving office now — and not just all the money you say you're losing. More importantly, think about what you would avoid. The coming weeks of the impeachment inquiry will be excruciating for you and the nation. There's now word that a second whistleblower is coming forward about your actions toward Ukraine. And while you insist there was never any quid pro quo, your own envoys to Ukraine have revealed damning texts suggesting just that: Bill Taylor, the senior US diplomat in Ukraine, wrote to the US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, ""I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign."" And the inquiry is just beginning. The Democrats will do their best to flaunt the most damning material they can find, and the media will be relentless in its search for the very information you have tried to keep hidden. Just imagine: If that phone call with the Ukrainian president -- the one you now say was ""perfect"" -- was enough to trigger an impeachment inquiry, what will happen when the less-""perfect"" details of your presidency become public? Surely many of your secrets will go to the grave with you, but you can be certain that many others will emerge under the spotlight. You have seemed immune to embarrassment and shame until now -- but that could change. Little by little, people who have worked for you have started talking. Perhaps most of your loyalists will keep quiet, but there are early signs of cracks. Former Republican Senator Jeff Flake said if the vote were private, at least 35 Republican senators would support impeaching you. But even if Republican officials remain subservient, you're not off the hook. Imagine how many government employees and private friends of yours know about your misdeeds. Most people who work in the government are not MAGA-hat wearers. They've kept their heads down and remained focused on their jobs, even as many were horrified by your thousands of lies, your insults against US allies, your policy of separating undocumented immigrant families and your defense of neo-Nazis. They know it may take a generation or more to restore America's good name in the world. Most people on their own are not heroes, but courage is contagious. How many US officials, who have kept quiet until now, will finally decide they've had enough? How many will decide they don't want to enable a president who has launched a campaign, such as yours in Ukraine, to undercut the US intelligence community and invite a foreign country to meddle in American democracy? There's a reason the whistleblower heard from several US officials concerned that you'd pressured the Ukrainian president to help you weaken Joe Biden's presidential bid. What will happen if and when a fuller transcript of that Ukraine call becomes public? After all, the White House's reconstruction of the 30-minute call may account for just a portion of the conversation, as Senator Angus King and others have noted. And we know that just as the White House officials locked away the full transcript of the Ukraine call, they've worked to lock away other calls. What might Americans learn about your conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman? It will go on and on. And it will ensnare some of your top confidants. People are already discussing whether Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Attorney General William Barr and your personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have committed crimes relating to efforts to dig up dirt on your political opponents (potential wrongdoing they deny). What if they strike a deal with Congress before you do, exchanging damaging information against you in exchange for leniency? The sooner you get out, the better your chance of displaying your mastery of the art of the deal. It will give you a chance to craft the narrative — to come up with a really good story about why you left. To be honest, some of us have been, shall we say, underwhelmed with your negotiating skills since you became president. It looks like North Korea is eating your (and America's) lunch; there's no deal with Iran, or with China, and no immigration deal with Congress. Maybe you can prove us wrong; maybe you are a great negotiator. You could announce you've decided to step down for the good of the country. You could pretend you don't want to see the country divided by a lengthy impeachment process, and you could stop warning about civil war-like consequences if you're removed from office, or calling your critics traitors. This is your chance. It could be the deal of a lifetime. If you play it right, the first paragraph of your obituary will describe you as the man who negotiated a historic resignation agreement to save the nation. instead of as the President who was impeached and perhaps convicted and removed from office and — not out of the question — who went on to face punishment. Now is the time.",0
"(CNN)Size does matter. As President Donald Trump tries to slash drastically the size of the National Security Council and make way for more political appointees instead, he's going to lose out on the important expertise and valuable relationships that career government employees bring to the NSC. National security adviser Robert O'Brien announced the staff cut Thursday after the whistleblower complaint detailed concerns raised by a number of White House staffers. The move looks a lot like an attempt to push out witnesses to Trump's potential crimes. If this is Trump's legal strategy, he needs new counsel. Cutting NSC staff won't protect him from Congress' power to call on key figures to testify about his behavior and alleged abuses of power -- in fact it may motivate more officials to come forward and speak freely about what they've seen or heard. As the House prepares to meet with a mix of current and former administration officials this week -- including Fiona Hill, a former top Russia and Ukraine official at the White House, US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, deputy assistant secretary of European and Eurasian affairs George Kent, and senior adviser to the secretary of state Ulrich Brechbuhl, the world is watching to see just what these staffers have to say about where and when Trump's personal insecurities trumped our national security. Russia is definitely listening One woman had a front-row seat to Trump's romance with Russia and his posture toward Ukraine. As the former senior director for Europe and Russia at the NSC, Fiona Hill's core responsibilities (if Trump let her fulfill them) should have included advising the President on all things Russia and Europe (including Ukraine); sitting in on all foreign meetings and engagements related to these topics; reviewing readouts; and helping run the official interagency process on her areas of responsibility. As part of her testimony next week, Congress will probably learn more about how Trump's clique of campaign surrogates -- some of whom were employed by the US government -- reportedly side-stepped this NSC process, and used their official titles to gain access to individuals and information that were politically helpful to Trump. Because of her portfolio at the White House, Hill will likely also have critical information to share about the President's behavior on Russia, including his calls with President Vladimir Putin and the dangerous 2017 meeting in which he declassified sensitive information in front of the Russian ambassador and foreign minister and reportedly said he was unconcerned about Russian election interference. Russia will definitely be listening to any news about what she says behind closed doors and will probably use it to continue their mission of sowing divisions in the US and undermining the credibility of our institutions, even though Trump is doing a good job of that already. All of this is an advantage to Russia. Ambassador in name only Ambassador Sondland is set to testify before the House next Thursday. Giving someone the title of ambassador doesn't mean that they're actually implementing US foreign policy. We learned that reading Sondland's text messages -- including those with Rudy Giuliani. It appears his actual portfolio wasn't high on his to-do list -- instead he facilitated inappropriate communications between the President's personal lawyer and Ukrainians. What we already know about his behavior undermines the credibility of the State Department, White House, and US foreign policy overall. Sondland reportedly called Trump before telling a top US ambassador there was ""no quid pro quo,"" -- a message that came from Trump himself, according to a source who spoke to the Washington Post. Sondland is reportedly going to testify that he didn't know whether the message was tru To top it off, the President, former national security adviser John Bolton, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo -- all of whom were mentioned in the text messages -- were probably aware that he was freelancing on Ukraine instead of doing his actual job. They were likely aware that he was side-stepping official anti-corruption channels and instead relying on Rudy to get access to information that could help the President's campae or not, just that the President relayed the message to him. The fact that Sondland was willing to parrot the President doesn't inspire a lot of confidence when it comes to delivering an honest testimony this week. Plus, because of the official perch that Trump gave him, Sondland had access a whole host of European officials. Congress may also want to ask Sondland if he used his Rolodex for Rudy on more than one occasion in more than one location. Reality check While Sondland, who donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, appears to have abused his title to further Trump's personal vendettas, plenty of diplomats are still working hard for the State Department. One of them -- deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasian affairs George Kent -- is also scheduled to testify next week, although the State Department may try to block his testimony like they did with Yovanovitch and Sondland. Kent is a real expert on the very issues that Trump, Giuliani, Sondland and former special envoy for Ukraine negotiations Kurt Volker spent so much time talking about: anti-corruption in Ukraine. Kent was the No. 2 at the embassy in Kiev from 2015 to 2018, and the anti-corruption coordinator for the State Department's European Bureau from 2014 to 2015. Kent, like Ambassador Yovanovitch, can share some facts on US anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine, including the work of former Vice President Joe Biden and other members of the Obama administration, along with organizations like the G-7, the International Monetary Fund and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. These facts will stand in stark contrast to the fiction that Trump and his squad are circulating. Kent's testimony about his interactions with acting ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor (who is not yet scheduled to testify) will be particularly important. Based on how the State Department operates, Taylor and Kent should have been in close touch, especially on priority issues like security assistance to Ukraine and Taylor's concerns about a perceived quid pro quo on the President's part. Plus, as deputy assistant secretary, Kent should have been involved in, or had knowledge of, the events that ultimately led John Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state, to tell Yovanovitch that she was being recalled from her post. Kent's testimony may shine more light on Trump's preference for using ambassadors like Sondland and Volker over seasoned professionals like Taylor, Kent, and Yovanovitch. His testimony will be key to Congress's oversight responsibilities, and will likely cement the notion that career State Department officials were cut out of key conversations and punished just for doing their actual jobs while their boss Secretary of State Pompeo failed, and is failing to speak up for them. Camp counselor Counselor of the US State Department Ulrich Brechbuhl listened in on Trump's July 25th call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to the whistleblower complaint. As a political appointee reporting to Pompeo, Brechbuhl's purview is expansive. His job is to be with the secretary of state at all times -- to staff him, know everything Pompeo knows or needs to know, implement his guidance, and communicate his priorities. The fact that he was allowed to listen in on a POTUS call indicates his access to sensitive information; State Department officials don't often have access to presidential calls. Any knowledge of or possible involvement in key issues like Yovanovitch's recall, the delayed release of security assistance to Ukraine, or efforts to investigate Biden, for example, will probably be top of mind for Congress. But because Pompeo really led two different Departments -- one staffed by career officials doing their actual jobs and another in which political appointees engaged in extracurricular activities to please POTUS -- whatever Brechbuhl has to say -- if he's allowed to testify -- will have an impact on the State Department's credibility. Brechbuhl will know Pompeo's reactions to unseemly requests from the President and why Pompeo's been so willing to let the President abuse power and potentially break the law. Pompeo still hasn't defended Ambassador Yovanovitch, for example, and he's been serving as Trump's personal diplomat -- defending his activities and pillorying anyone who disagrees with them. The House has said that more depositions will be scheduled -- and this may be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to officials wanting to share their experiences with Congress. The White House and the State Department may try to block officials from speaking up, but that may only motivate them further. Either way, the world is watching, listening, and reading about how several senior officials probably abused our system. That degrades our ability to implement credible foreign policy and for dedicated government officials to do their jobs as they are sidelined by those pursuing work on behalf of the President's personal needs, and not US national security.",0
"(CNN)The religious and cultural divide between Democratic and Republican voters is widening, pointing toward even greater partisan polarization and social tension as the nation careens into a possible impeachment vote against President Donald Trump and potential record turnout in the 2020 presidential election. An extensive national study released Monday by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute showed that voters in each party now hold antithetical views not only on issues that dominate the immediate political debate -- such as health care and impeachment -- but also on deeper changes in the nation's demography, culture, race relations and gender roles, according to detailed results the institute provided to CNN. ""It's not just politics -- it goes all the way down to perceptions of culture and how things are shifting,"" Robert P. Jones, the institute's founding CEO, said Monday in a briefing while releasing the results. This separation in attitudes is rooted in an even deeper divergence between the two sides: While whites who identify as Christians still represent about two-thirds of all Republicans, they now compose only one-fourth of Democrats, according to results provided by the Pew Research Center from a new study it released last week. Americans unaffiliated with any religion, and racial minorities who identify as Christians, now each make up a bigger share of the Democratic coalition than white Christians do, Pew found. Both groups remain only relatively minor components of the GOP coalition. Heading into the 2020 election, the religious landscape thus presents the same complex political dynamic as many other measures of change such as racial diversity, education levels and the transition to the information-age economy. Shrinking groups tilt toward GOP On the religious front, just as in those other arenas, the groups that favor Democrats are clearly growing. Not only have the religiously unaffiliated expanded since 2009 from about 1 in 6 to 1 in 4 adults, but the share of Americans who ascribe to non-Christian faiths, a group that also leans strongly Democratic, has edged up from 5% to 7% of the population over that time, Pew found. Simultaneously, white Christians have fallen as a share of all American adults -- from just over half in 2009, according to Pew and other data, to around two-fifths today. The challenge for Democrats is that their potential gains from the growing groups are being muted by an increasing tilt toward the GOP among the groups that are shrinking, in this case whites who identify as Christian. (The same dynamic is evident among other contracting groups such as whites without college degrees.) The combined result has left the parties on something of a treadmill, as Republicans offset at least some of the demographic change that benefits Democrats with improved performance among the key groups of shrinking white voters. Trump has accelerated the trends on both sides of that equation, consolidating the GOP's position among blue-collar, older, non-urban and evangelical whites at the price of sparking intense resistance among younger, white-collar, nonwhite and metropolitan voters. For most of American history, white Christians represented a majority of the population; as recently as 1991, they still constituted about three-fourths of all adults, according to results in the annual General Social Survey from the National Opinion Research Center. But as America has grown more racially and religiously diverse, and more secular, white Christians fell below majority status of the population for the first time sometime between 2010 and 2012, according to the National Opinion Research Center data. White Christians compose just 41% of the adult population in the latest Pew data (which combines nearly 170,000 survey interviews from 2018 and 2019). Democrats' religious profile very different But even as white Christians have declined as a share of the population, more of that shrinking group is aligning with Republicans. In 2009, Pew found 51% of white Christians identified as Republicans, while 37% considered themselves Democrats (the rest were independents). Today that 14-point partisan gap has more than doubled: In the latest Pew results, 63% of white Christians identify as Republicans, compared with 30% who identify as Democrats. The movement has been even sharper among white evangelical Protestants. Their share of the overall population is also shrinking: It fell to 16% in the latest Pew results, down from 19% in 2009. In 2009, they were about twice as likely to identify as Republicans (61%) as Democrats (30%), according to figures provided by Gregory Smith, Pew's associate director of research. Today 75% of white evangelicals call themselves Republicans, while just 19% identify as Democrats, a ratio of nearly 4 to 1. As a result, even as white Christians have fallen below majority status in the country, they remain a clear majority of Republicans. In all, 64% of Republicans identify as white Christians in the latest Pew data. (The PRRI findings put the figure even slightly higher, at nearly 70%). That means white Christians now represent about the same share of Republicans as they did in the country overall in 1998. White evangelical Protestants alone represent 30% of Republicans, about double their share in the general population, Pew found. The Democrats' religious profile could not be more distinct. White Christians now make up only 25% of Democrats, Pew found, down sharply from 40% in 2009. (White evangelicals compose only 7% of all Democrats.) Today, a larger share of Democrats in the Pew results are either not affiliated with any religion (34%) or are nonwhite Christians (30%), Pew found. Another 9% of Democrats adhere to non-Christian faiths. In each of those three latter cases, that's about double the share of Republicans in those categories. Mirror images on the issues The new Public Religion Research Institute study, its annual American Values Survey, underscores the implications of a reconfiguring partisan alignment. Democrats rely on voters who reflect the nation's growing racial and religious diversity, while the contracting population of white Christians -- especially white evangelical Protestants -- tilt more toward the GOP as a vehicle to protect values and a vision of America that they believe is under siege from the forces of change. To map the divide between these two coalitions, the Public Religion Research Institute at my request ran the results for some of the survey's core questions among voters who approve and disapprove of Trump's performance in office. (In all 39% of adults approved of Trump's performance while 60% disapproved.) Across the key changes reshaping American culture, the two groups rendered almost inverse verdicts. On gender, roughly three-fifths of adults who approve of Trump agreed that ""these days society seems to punish men just for acting like men."" Three-fourths of adults who disapprove of Trump disagreed. Two-thirds of Trump approvers likewise agreed that ""Society as a whole has become too soft and feminine,"" while nearly three-fourths of those who disapproved of him disagreed. The divide between the two sides was even more pronounced on issues relating to race. Fully 68% of those who approve of Trump agreed that ""Today, discrimination against whites has become as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities."" Three-fourths of those who disapprove of Trump disagreed with that sentiment. Over three-fifths of Trump approvers agreed with the harshly phrased sentiment that ""Immigrants are invading our country and replacing our cultural and ethnic background."" Four-fifths of voters who disapproved of Trump rejected that sentiment. Differing views among Christians On a revealing broader question, almost exactly three-fourths of adults who approved of Trump said the Democratic Party ""has been taken over by socialists."" A nearly identical three-fourths of Trump disapprovers said the Republican Party ""has been taken over by racists."" At the heart of these contrasts are the inimical views of white evangelical Protestants and religiously unaffiliated Americans (of all races), which now arguably represent the core of each party's coalition. While two-thirds of white evangelicals, for instance, say discrimination against whites is as big a problem as discrimination against minorities, more than 7 in 10 among the religiously unaffiliated disagree. Two-thirds of white evangelicals say immigrants are ""invading"" America; three-fourths of the religiously unaffiliated disagree. Three-fourths of white evangelicals say socialists have taken over the Democratic Party; two-thirds of the unaffiliated say racists now control the Republican Party. The groups diverge in their assessment of every element of Trump's performance. Three-fourths of the unaffiliated say Trump has encouraged white supremacy; 70% of white evangelicals say he has not. Four-fifths of the unaffiliated disapprove of Trump's job performance; more than three-fourths of the evangelicals approve. More than three-fifths of the unaffiliated support Trump's impeachment and removal; nearly 9 in 10 evangelicals oppose it. White evangelicals stand out for their staunchly conservative positions on virtually every aspect of demographic and cultural change. Other white Christians appear more conflicted, though on balance they also lean slightly toward the right. A majority of both white mainline Protestants and white Catholics did reject the ideas that society is too soft and feminine, that it punishes men and that immigrants are ""invading"" America. But a narrow majority of each say socialists have taken over the Democratic Party. A solid majority also reject the notion that racists have captured the GOP, and majorities support an array of Trump-style policies on immigration, including reducing legal immigration, building his proposed wall across the Southern border and temporarily banning immigration from Muslim countries. Nearly three-fifths of white Catholics and just over half of white Protestants also believe discrimination against whites is as much a problem as discrimination against minorities. Still, a majority of white mainline Protestants and (especially) white Catholics say Trump has damaged the dignity of the presidency, and both groups divide about in half on whether they approve of his performance in office (with white Protestants slightly more positive than the Catholics). Changes most striking among youth Though both groups have been shrinking, their future allegiance looms as a critical near-term factor in national politics, particularly given their prevalence in the Rust Belt battlegrounds that remain at the tipping point of presidential elections. Still, the long-run threat to Republicans clearly emerges from these new studies: The party, especially as defined by Trump, faces huge resistance among the groups that are growing in society, while the groups most drawn to his racial nationalism -- such as white evangelicals -- are shrinking. Today, per the Pew findings, there are about four white Christians for every three adults who are either unaffiliated or practice a non-Christian faith. As recently as 2009, there were more than seven white Christians for every three adults in those other two categories. How white evangelicals could reelect Trump Given that pace of change, it's an open question how long Republicans can rely on the Trump strategy of squeezing bigger margins from shrinking groups. On most key measures, from racial diversity to the shift away from Christian faiths, the changes reshaping America are more pronounced among the youngest generations. Among adults younger than 30, only 1 in 4 are white Christians, the Public Religion Research Institute found, with the religiously unaffiliated and those who practice non-Christian faiths accounting for nearly half and non-white Christians making up the remaining fourth. That means that if Republicans can't make more inroads with the diverse groups that are growing, they will constantly need bigger margins from their diminishing white groups just to stay in place. As Jones, of the Public Religion Research Institute, noted in an email, ""Republicans look about like 65-year-old America or about like America did back in the mid-1990s, while Democrats look about like 30-year-old America or about like [what the] country is going to look a decade from now, if current trends continue."" This wave of new data on religion and partisan allegiance underscores the broader conclusion that American politics in 2020, and likely for years beyond, promises an epic collision between what America has been and what it is becoming.",1
"When the House of Representatives launched its impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump over the Ukraine scandal, the White House decried it as ""invalid"" and ""baseless,"" and ordered some subpoenaed officials not to testify to Congress. This obstructionist strategy worked once before, as the White House effectively stonewalled the House Judiciary Committee's investigation of Robert Mueller's findings on Russian election interference by instructing executive branch employees not to comply with subpoenas. But this time, something is different. Now, some executive branch employees who had received orders from the White House to clam up chose to comply with the House's request for testimony, as required by law. By doing so, those dutiful public officials met their oath of office to uphold the Constitution and, in the process, called the White House's high-stakes bluff. Former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch defied the White House's instruction to remain silent and instead testified to the House about the efforts of Trump's counsel, Rudy Giuliani, to have her removed from her post; one House member said she gave a ""gripping and emotional account of presidential abuse of power."" Fiona Hill, Trump's former top Russia adviser, testified White House officials were alarmed by Trump's potentially illegal conduct toward Ukraine even before the July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky. And Ambassador Gordon Sondland testified Trump ordered diplomatic professionals to deal with Ukraine through Giuliani, which left Sondland ""disappointed"" -- particularly when he discovered (later, he claimed) that Giuliani's agenda included prompting Ukraine to investigate Trump's political rivals. Trump could have tried to enforce his direction to executive branch employees not to cooperate by going to court and seeking restraining orders preventing them from testifying. But -- perhaps recognizing that his legal grounding was shaky at best -- he didn't. Trump blinked. He got caught bluffing and, when Yovanovitch and others called him, he folded. Now that the parade of witnesses has started, Congress and the public will learn more about Trump's efforts to push Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. Bill Taylor -- the top US diplomat in Ukraine, who famously texted Sondland that it would be ""crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign"" -- provided devastating testimony Tuesday. In his opening statement, Taylor established clear as day that there absolutely was a ""quid pro quo"" of American foreign aid in exchange for Ukrainian investigations of Trump's political rivals. Taylor's testimony reportedly has made a major impact, with one House Democrat calling it a ""sea change"" and another saying it ""resolved any remaining doubts I may have."" Taken together, the testimony of the public officials that have testified so far paints a damning picture. Had they meekly obeyed the White House's instructions to stay quiet -- as Don McGahn, Mike Pompeo and others did before -- neither Congress nor the public would have had a full understanding of Trump's apparent misuse of office and abuse of power. But by refusing to capitulate, these public servants have caused the White House's previously impregnable stone wall to start to crumble.",1
"Washington (CNN)There is no evidence to support President Donald Trump's claim, made repeatedly this past week, that top US diplomat to Ukraine Bill Taylor is a ""Never Trumper."" The low-key diplomat rose to global attention after testifying on Capitol Hill in the impeachment inquiry. He provided a damning account of how Trump told his appointees to establish a quid pro quo, trading much-needed US military aid for political favors from Ukraine. Trump first made the unfounded accusation against Taylor in a tweet on Wednesday, and repeated it twice on Friday to a gaggle of reporters on the White House lawn. ""Here's the problem,"" Trump said, referring to Taylor. ""He's a Never Trumper and his lawyer's a Never Trumper."" Taylor's career There is no indication that Taylor has ever donated to political candidates for federal office, according to Federal Election Commission data. Taylor has a relatively common name, but there are no records matching his name, home state of Virginia and employment history. After he was appointed by then-President George W. Bush to be the US ambassador to Ukraine in 2006, he told lawmakers that he never contributed to any political campaigns, according to the congressional record. He was confirmed by voice vote by the Republican-controlled Senate. At that time, Taylor disclosed that his wife made one political donation before: She gave $150 in 2003 to 21st Century Democrats, a political action committee that backs ""genuinely progressive"" and ""populist"" Democrats. The group endorsed Barack Obama's campaign for Senate in 2004. In the Senate disclosures, Taylor detailed a slew of donations his parents gave to Republicans over the years. This included money to Arizona Sen. John McCain, Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ""I've known Bill Taylor for 26 years, and he doesn't take positions based on politics,"" said former US Ambassador to Ukraine Carlos Pascual, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton and stayed on during the Bush administration. ""Bill Taylor is a guy who volunteered for Vietnam. He isn't a radical. Anyone who starts barking up that tree has got to get their facts straight."" Nine additional former State Department officials who previously spoke to CNN described Taylor as a person of high character who was more likely to put sound foreign policy before politics. He was so respected that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asked him to come out of retirement to lead the US embassy in Kiev this year, a position he first held during the Bush administration. Trump's disdain for Taylor apparently isn't shared by Pompeo, one of the President's closest allies. In an interview on Friday with The Sunflower, the student-run newspaper at Wichita State University, Pompeo voiced some subdued approval of Taylor's performance since taking over in Ukraine. ""He and I both share this vision for how American interests in Ukraine can properly be represented. I have every reason to think that he's still out there, banging away at that problem set,"" Pompeo said. What about Taylor's lawyer? Unlike Trump's claims against Taylor, his criticism of Taylor's lawyer John Bellinger is accurate. Someone as outspoken as Bellinger is surely an interesting choice of attorney for Taylor, who has been described as a ""quiet guy"" by people who know him well. But associating with Bellinger does not make Taylor a Never Trumper himself. He may have just wanted an attorney with strong credentials in DC. A registered Republican, Bellinger served under the Bush administration first as senior associate counsel to the President and later as legal adviser to the State Department. In August 2016, months before the general election, Bellinger drafted a letter that was co-signed by 50 senior Republican national security and foreign policy experts and stated that Trump was ""not qualified"" to be President and ""would put at risk our country's national security and well-being."" ""(Trump) weakens U.S. moral authority as the leader of the free world,"" the letter said. ""He appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the U.S. Constitution, U.S. laws, and U.S. institutions, including religious tolerance, freedom of the press, and an independent judiciary."" After Trump was elected, Bellinger joined ""Checks and Balances,"" a group of conservative lawyers formed to speak out against Trump. The group also includes George Conway, husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who supports impeachment and rails against Trump almost daily on Twitter. Bellinger told The New York Times that the group came together because they felt ""conservative lawyers are not doing enough to protect constitutional principles that are being undermined by the statements and actions of this president.""",0
"Washington (CNN)An impeachment net is fast closing around President Donald Trump, with the House of Representatives poised to cast its highly symbolic first vote Thursday in the Democratic bid to oust the President. A domino effect of developments that appeared to threaten Trump emphasized the momentum of the impeachment drive on the eve of the vote, amid unsuccessful efforts by Republicans on Capitol Hill to gum up the process. Thursday promises to be an even more consequential day, since new testimony is expected from a key White House insider and proceedings in several court cases could further unglue the President's defense. The full House will be asked to pass a resolution setting out the rules and terms of the impeachment inquiry. The measure provides for open hearings and a written report on the case, and permits Trump to be represented by counsel and minority Republicans to subpoena their own witnesses with the majority's agreement. The vote will mark a new peak in the confrontation between the President and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- the two most powerful politicians in Washington -- both of whose careers could be on the line in the impeachment fight. Pelosi resisted impeachment demands from liberals in her caucus for months during the controversy over Russian election interference. But she has moved fast against the President since the Ukraine scandal burst into the open, even though the showdown could have unpredictable political consequences, especially if it spills into an election year. ""Mr. Clyburn, our whip, has given me a very good report about our vote tomorrow. He's the whip, the vote counter. Thank you, Mr. Clyburn,"" Pelosi said at an event in Washington on Wednesday night. The vote could be a tough one for a small corps of Democrats who have yet to back impeachment and for party lawmakers from districts that Trump won in 2016 but that helped Democrats grab back the House last year. It will also give Republicans a chance to make a political point to voters back home by standing with the President -- who remains wildly popular among GOP base voters. The White House is digging in, insisting that Trump did nothing wrong, as the widening contours become clear of a scandal sparked by accusations that he abused his power by seeking political favors from Ukraine. But the President's case appeared to absorb new blows on Wednesday. CNN reported that Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top White House Ukraine expert, testified that he believed Trump was personally blocking $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to force the ex-Soviet state to probe Joe Biden. Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, signaled he is willing to return to Washington to testify in public after appearing to indicate a quid pro quo between Trump and Ukraine in a bombshell closed-door deposition last week. It emerged that Tim Morrison, Trump's top Russia expert on the National Security Council, is leaving his job -- raising expectations for his deposition Thursday on Capitol Hill. Three House committees investigating the President invited John Bolton to testify next week. The former national security adviser could be a compelling witness, though it is not clear he would show up even if he is subpoenaed. Democrats open historic process on impeachment Wednesday's fast-moving developments in the case came as Democrats convened the House Rules Committee to transition the impeachment inquiry to a more public phase. The full House will vote on the resolution Thursday following weeks of demands from Republicans for a formal authorization. That step is not required by the Constitution and Democrats insist that Thursday's vote is merely to formalize the process of pursuing the investigation. House Rules Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Massachusetts, noted that only three previous presidents have faced the prospect of impeachment during nearly 250 years of US history. ""This is a sad day,"" he said. ""No one runs for Congress to impeach a president, but we are here today because the facts compel us to be. There is serious evidence that the President may have violated the Constitution."" But Republicans, who have struggled to directly counter the evidence emerging from the Democratic inquiry, renewed their efforts to portray the process as an unconstitutional sham. GOP members of the House Rules Committee sought to make the resolution more favorable to their party -- and called for wider subpoena powers than the Democratic majority is willing to grant. ""This is nothing more than a fishing expedition,"" said Rep. Michael Burgess of Texas. McGovern replied: ""Others call it congressional oversight."" Republican Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who as Senate majority leader would facilitate the impeachment trial of the President, slammed the Democratic-led House, saying it is failing to give Trump due process. ""Unfortunately, the draft resolution that has been released does nothing of that sort. If falls way, way short,"" he said. New testimony on core impeachment question The allegation at the center of the impeachment case is that Trump personally pressured Ukraine's President to investigate a potential 2020 election rival, Biden, and his family. CNN's Jake Tapper reported that Vindman had told investigators Tuesday that he was sure Trump personally blocked military aid and that a quid pro quo had existed two weeks before the now-notorious phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Two sources present at Vindman's deposition said Bolton had instructed the Army lieutenant colonel to prepare a decision memo by August 15 arguing for funds to be released to Ukraine as soon as possible. Vindman later learned that Trump refused to free up the aid, after the President met Bolton and other senior Cabinet officials at his New Jersey golf resort. The revelation makes Bolton's testimony even more potentially crucial. Multiple witnesses have already testified that the former national security adviser had raised alarms about an apparent shadow foreign policy in Ukraine run by Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Bolton's lawyer Charles Cooper said Wednesday that his client would not show up without a subpoena. But it is not clear if he would testify even if he is served. Bolton's former aide Charles Kupperman has asked a court to decide whether he should testify despite the White House's objections. A federal judge will hold a hearing in that case Thursday to set proceedings. In another federal courtroom, a judge will hear arguments on whether former White House counsel Don McGahn has immunity from testifying in the impeachment investigation. Morrison testimony could bolster impeachment case There are already indications that Morrison's testimony could be among the most crucial so far. CNN has reported that he will corroborate key elements of Taylor's account that Trump was pressing for Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into Biden, and his son Hunter. Morrison's name was cited 15 times in Taylor's opening statement, which Democrats view as damning for Trump. News that he is leaving his job soon after 15 months on the National Security Council raised expectations that he could become the latest official to provide evidence deemed damaging to the President. A stream of career foreign service or military officials have effectively sidestepped the White House's ambition of clamping a policy of noncooperation with the Democratic impeachment process. Ahead of the House vote on Thursday, Republican members signaled they would stick with a strategy of criticizing the process -- despite a push by Trump and allies for a more direct defense against the substance of the Democrats' charges. The President fired off another blast of furious tweets at the Democratic investigators and the witnesses cooperating with the probe as part of his wider misinformation campaign. He claimed that Vindman ""could find NO Quid Pro Quo in the Transcript of the phone call. There were many people listening to the call. How come they (including the President of Ukraine) found NOTHING wrong with it. Witch Hunt!"" Sen. William Cohen, a Maine Republican and former US defense secretary, compared Trump's rhetoric to that of George Orwell's novel ""1984"" and said the President sounded like a dictator. ""He feels that he alone can take action, without regard to any of the other institutions which are there to make sure that the rule of law stays intact,"" Cohen told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.",1
"What we covered here The latest: President Trump spoke with reporters today on the south lawn of the White House about the impeachment inquiry and whistleblower, who he called a “never Trumper” and “a radical."" Defending Trump: Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the President, said today that asking a foreign leader to investigate a political rival is “not impeachable” and repeatedly denied that there was a quid pro quo related to Ukrainian military aid. Getting prepared: Democrats are discussing a time frame that would include public impeachment hearings before Thanksgiving and votes on whether to impeach Trump by Christmas, multiple Democratic sources have told CNN.",1
" (CNN)The Joker told Batman, ""This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object."" That line, from the closing minutes of ""The Dark Knight"", is one way to anticipate what will happen on Capitol Hill next week: Public hearings in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump begin Wednesday. The unstoppable force? A parade of witnesses testifying that Trump's White House appeared to be shaking down Ukraine's president to force an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, despite a lack of evidence of wrongdoing. The immovable object: Trump and his GOP supporters, who this week tried out an array of defenses, including Sen. Lindsey Graham saying he won't read the witnesses' transcripts and that the process is ""BS."" ""As the President faces an impeachment inquiry, he, like any individual facing a serious allegation, has a right to mount a robust defense,"" noted Elliot Williams. ""However, President Trump's behavior toward those tasked with congressional oversight and investigations into his personal conduct, and his attitude toward the current congressional impeachment inquiry are all rooted in the same idea: that our country's basic systems themselves are illegitimate."" Trump is relying on ""public mistrust of government"" and showing he doesn't understand the limits on presidential power, Williams wrote. The problem for Democrats is that Trump's approach may be working, wrote Susan Glasser in the New Yorker. ""The allegations of abuse of power are striking and unprecedented: a President seeking to privatize American foreign policy for his personal political benefit."" But we know how this will end, she suggested. ""For Trump and his defenders, it is a coup, a show trial, a witch hunt. When that is the starting point, there is no place for the facts, no process that can satisfy, no way to split the difference... the President has successfully rendered the investigation irrelevant, at least for his most fervent supporters.""",1
" (CNN)It was a powerful television moment: the ex-US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, listening to a snippet from a rough transcript of President Donald Trump -- the man who ousted her -- predicting to a foreign leader, ""She's going to go through some things."" ""It sounded like a threat,"" Yovanovitch testified during her public hearing before the House Intelligence Committee Friday. Then to top it, Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff read aloud a fresh Trump attack on Yovanovitch, tweeted in the midst of her testimony: ""Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,"" Trump wrote. ""She started off in Somalia, how did that go?..."" Asked about the tweet, the veteran ambassador, who worked for 33 years in the State Department, responded, ""It's very intimidating."" ""Let's be clear: his tweet was terrible,"" Republican strategist Doug Heye wrote. ""It was also nonsensical. To blame Ambassador Yovanovich for the 1990s troubles in Somalia, where she served as a foreign service officer, not ambassador, is so preposterous it can be dismissed out of hand."" Frida Ghitis summed up Yovanovich's role: ""An American hero, attacked by an American president; removed from her post not because she failed to do her job but because she was doing it too well. As a result of Trump's actions, American policy went from supporting anti-corruption efforts to combating them. And for whose benefit?"" Friday's hearing, which took place as Trump ally Roger Stone was being convicted in a Washington courthouse of lying to Congress, capped the first week of public sessions on the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry. On Wednesday, Bill Taylor, who now serves as America's leading diplomat in Ukraine, described what he called a ""highly irregular"" Ukraine policy channel operating in parallel to the traditional State Department structure. It was led by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and included US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, special envoy Kurt Volker and Energy Secretary Rick Perry -- referred to by Schiff as ""The Three Amigos."" Not that outlandish Republicans offered a variety of defenses for Trump, but the rhetorical height came when GOP counsel Steve Castor asked Taylor, ""In fairness, this irregular channel of diplomacy, it's not as outlandish as it could be. Is that correct?"" Paul Begala wrote that none of the Republican defenses made sense. ""What we heard -- and saw -- was the death of the Republican Party's commitment to truth, principle, dignity and the Constitution,"" Begala argued. ""Here's what we did not hear Republicans say today: 'Donald Trump is innocent.' 'President Trump would never leverage lifesaving, taxpayer-funded military aid to extort and bribe an ally.'"" Scott Jennings argued that Trump deserves credit for the lethal military aid now being provided to Ukraine, a step that President Barack Obama resisted. ""Democrats want to toss out an American president for a brief delay in military aid to Ukraine under Trump, who is actually providing the Ukrainians with lethal aid -- including sniper rifles, rocket launchers and Javelin anti-tank missiles -- to combat the Russians."" Republicans made much of the fact that none of the first three witnesses had any direct contact with Trump. Asha Rangappa wrote, ""This, of course, only underscores the necessity of having former National Security Advisor John Bolton and Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney -- both of whom who have firsthand knowledge of Trump's intentions towards Ukraine -- testify. Trump, however, has blocked both from providing testimony, undercutting Republicans' implication that their testimony would exonerate the President."" Another line of defense from right-leaning media outlets, after Wednesday's first hearing with Taylor and a top State Department official overseeing Ukraine, George Kent, was that the hearing was ""boring"" and wouldn't engage ordinary Americans' interest. The argument did not surprise Nicole Hemmer: ""Fox News, which for the past three years has been working as a propaganda arm of the administration has to find a way to undermine the evidence that the hearings will expose the American people to in the coming days.""",0
"Does it deliver a hefty domestic political payoff, reverse an Obama administration position, upturn international law and irritate the European Union? If so, it's probably a Trump administration foreign policy decision. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday that the US now rejects a 1978 State Department legal opinion that deemed Israeli settlements in the West Bank ""inconsistent with international law."" Like moving the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2017, this dramatic new stance on settlements -- considered illegal by the United Nations and EU -- further deprives the Palestinians of leverage and validates Benjamin Netanyahu's close relationship with Trump at an existential moment for the Israeli PM. Perhaps more important for the US President, Monday's decision is a gift to conservative evangelical voters who support Israel for reasons of biblical prophecy, as well as to his US donors who are also supportive of right-wing politicians in Israel. The administration says the change could bring a just Middle East peace closer, and that it took a year of legal analysis to arrive at this decision. Every president's political leanings naturally influence American foreign policy. But no recent administration has been so keen as Trump's to fracture enduring US policy positions -- even at the risk of infringing US valuesFrom Iran to North Korea to trans-Atlantic relations, this White House has a record of retrofitting policy to match Trump's political bottom line. This summer, Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping that he would keep mum on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong while trade talks took place. And the current impeachment inquiry centers on whether he politicized security aid to Ukraine by pressuring the country's President to investigate Trump's potential political rival Joe Biden. As US diplomatic aide David Holmes testified, quoting the US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, what Trump cares about is the ""big stuff"" that benefits him.",1
"Washington (CNN)Maybe it was President Donald Trump's mention of the Miss Universe pageant. Or his allegiance to the Kardashians. Or that the Ukrainian President loves his ass. Whenever it happened, at some point during hours of hearings it became clear this was an impeachment inquiry the Trump era deserves: a high-low juxtaposition of damning testimony from serious people peppered with the absurdist footnotes of a madcap presidency. In some ways, all impeachment proceedings become mirrors to their time. Bill Clinton's, with its soap opera details and biological evidence, reflected the moral divide of the late nineties. Two decades before, Richard Nixon's Watergate signaled a seedy end to golden postwar America. As historians write their chapters on the country's fourth impeachment proceeding, perhaps they will omit Trump's disposition for morning grouchiness, revealed by the American Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland. And maybe they will skip over the repeated, unexplained references to nude photos of the President. If they do, they will fail to capture the essential strangeness of the story unspooling in the stately Ways and Means room, where witnesses have collectively described an untraditional president using his office for political gain. The oddities Indeed, the oddities help get to the heart of what the impeachment proceedings are about: Trump's distaste for presidential norms, his shunning of career professionals and his embrace of free-radicals the likes of whom have surrounded him for decades. They fill out the portrait of a president whose interests and attention are rarely where those who work for him want them to be. The clash between those two worlds has fueled much of the public hearings, which concluded on Thursday. The ways they intersected prompted laughter and worry but mostly a combination of the two -- itself a clean summation of the Trump presidency. There was the way David Holmes, a career foreign service officer posted in Kiev, demonstrated with his hands how Sondland recoiled from his unsecured cellphone as Trump screamed his greetings on the other end of the line. ""He sort of winced and held the phone away from his ear, like this,"" Holmes said, contorting his face in pain and making the movement over and over. The story had a point; Holmes was attempting to explain why he could hear Trump mention ""the investigations"" on another person's phone call, which was placed in full view of restaurant patrons and probably Russian surveillance agencies. Even those worrying aspects could not obscure the sense of ridiculous. As Holmes was recounting his follow-up conversation, his voice took on a bemused pique after recalling Sondland's claim Trump only cared about ""big things"" in Ukraine. ""There was big stuff,"" he deadpanned. ""Like a war with Russia."" Humor and the absurd When Rep. Devin Nunes, the House Intelligence Committee's top Republican, read the entire transcript of Trump's April phone call with the Ukrainian President, he couldn't avoid reading the part where Trump tells Volodymyr Zelensky how well his country fared in the beauty pageant he once owned. ""When I owned Miss Universe, they always had great people. Ukraine was always very well represented,"" Nunes read, quoting the President, before the 33-year veteran of the foreign service that Trump fired from her post in Ukraine began her testimony. It was during that same phone call Trump's aides had hoped he would raise the issue of corruption, a pervasive problem in Ukraine on which Republicans insist Trump is laser-focused. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman testified it was in his talking points. Trump never raised it. ""The President could choose to use the talking points or not, he's the president,"" Vindman said. ""But they were not consistent with what I provided."" No one embodied the Trump era's clash of cultures better than Sondland, who testified Wednesday with a perma-grin even as he was implicating Trump and his senior-most aides in a bribery scheme involving stalled US aid to Ukraine. A rich man who didn't really try to rebut the suggestion he purchased his ambassadorship with a $1 million contribution to Trump's inaugural fund, Sondland described having a near-direct line to the President and a mandate to execute his wishes in Ukraine alongside a group he named the ""three amigos."" Their rapport was hardly the stuff of diplomatic cables. At one point, Sondland told Trump he could ""tell the Kardashians you tried"" securing the release of the rapper A$AP Rocky. At another, he told Trump that Zelensky ""loves your ass."" ""Yes, it sounds like something I would say,"" he confirmed to laughter. ""That's how President Trump and I communicate, a lot of four-letter words. In this case, three-letter."" More laughter. Stark contrasts The contrast between Sondland's testimony and the accounts of the careerists was stark. The foreign service officers, Pentagon officials and senior national security aides all relied on notes they took in real time, a practice instilled in them by trade that made them attractive witnesses for Democrats. Sondland, meanwhile, admitted that wasn't his style. ""I am not a note-taker or a memo-writer. Never have been,"" he told the committee. The casual approach only seemed to underscore the difference between the presidency Trump is occupying and the government that officials are trying to sustain around it. It's the difference between the Miss Universe pageant and the ""hot war"" raging in eastern Ukraine; a promise made to the Kardashians and a strong line on corruption. The officials who appeared over the past two weeks seemed intent on continuing their serious work, even as it became clear over the course of the hearings that Trump either doesn't care or pays it little notice. For Fiona Hill, Trump's former senior Russia adviser, the realization seemed to come in the very moment she was testifying. Perhaps inured to shock after more than two years in the White House, she appeared neither upset nor surprised about the discovery, which she described matter-of-factly on Thursday. ""It struck me when yesterday, when you put up on the screen Ambassador Sondland's emails,"" she said. ""He was being involved in a domestic political errand, and we were being involved in national security foreign policy, and those two things had just diverged."" ""I had not put my finger on that -- at the moment,"" she went on. ""I did say to him, Ambassador Sondland, 'Gordon, I think this is all going to blow up.' And here we are.""",1
"On September 24, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, following his controversial call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. In the July call, Trump asked Zelensky to do him a ""favor"" and launch an investigation into 2020 rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Was Trump committing an impeachable offense, or was he doing what world leaders do on occasion -- asking an ally for assistance into potential corruption?The answer to that question depends less on the facts in front of you -- and more on what you already think about Trump. For those who don't approve of Trump, the log of the call supplied by the White House, the subsequently released text messages between US diplomats and the public depositions, further prove what they have long thought about the President: that Trump does not respect the office he holds and that he is using the presidency to further his personal interests. For those who support the President, the call, text messages and depositions prove almost the exact opposite: that Trump did nothing wrong in asking a foreign ally to look into a potential case of corruption. Indeed, how can the President be impeached for putting pressure on a foreign leader, when the Ukraine President himself denied that this was what happened? This example illustrates an important point about political reasoning in an era of polarized politics: Facts appear to have little influence on voters' opinions. Republicans and Democrats have the same evidence at their disposal -- the log of the call, the text messages and the depositions -- and still they reach opposite conclusions about whether the President should be impeached.At first glance, it might not seem problematic that people with opposing views arrive at different conclusions from the same set of facts. Yet, the issue is that people do not always examine the facts first and then arrive at a conclusion. They do the exact opposite -- deciding on a conclusion and then twisting the facts to support it. If we think Trump is the biggest threat to American democracy, we can find wrongdoing in a turn of phrase in a phone call. If we believe that Trump is a leader in democracy and morality, we can easily explain why there is nothing wrong in asking a foreign leader to investigate potential wrongdoing. So, why does this happen? Political psychological research suggests that reasoning is not always geared toward finding the ""right"" conclusion -- whatever the conclusion might be -- from a given set of facts but rather used to confirm a predefined one. We want to confirm what we already believe, or what psychologists refer to as confirmation bias, and we do this by collecting and interpreting evidence in ways that support our prior beliefs. In terms of politics, this means that partisans want to confirm their existing beliefs on political issues and favor politicians who represent those beliefs. For example, once Republicans have decided that Trump is doing a good job as president, they will find reasons for why new evidence, like a log of a phone call, is consistent with their view of his leadership.This tendency is not just limited to the Trump era or one particular side of the political aisle. Three years ago, as former President Barack Obama was ending his term, I conducted a large-scale randomized experiment among self-identified Democratic and Republican voters regarding their interpretation of new numbers on economic growth. The goal of the experiment was to expose participants to information that either showed economic growth was strong or sluggish, thus reflecting positively or negatively on the President. The results showed that while Republican and Democratic voters were willing to accept the facts at hand and adjust their beliefs about the state of the economy in the direction of the new economic evidence, they were still remarkably apt in explaining away these facts to match their preexisting partisan beliefs. When confronted with positive growth, Democrats were eager to attribute responsibility to Obama's economic policies, while Republicans were prone to alleviate him of responsibility, pointing instead to the success of US companies and trends in global markets.When the exact same indicator pointed in a negative direction, voters reasoning patterns flipped: Democrats suddenly mustered up reasons for why Obama was not at fault, while Republicans blamed Obama's economic policies. It is not that these arguments are wrong in and of themselves. The point is that we use such arguments opportunistically -- to make new facts fit with a conclusion that we have already decided on, in this case that Obama was good or bad for the economy. On rare occasions, of course, irrefutable facts do change the course of history. Just think about how the Watergate scandal eventually brought down former President Richard Nixon. The Gallup polls from the time also tell a remarkable story of how public support for impeaching Nixon grew as the revelations mounted, suggesting that facts can make a difference. But what is also remarkable about the Nixon period is that even after all evidence was on the table -- including the tapes that directly proved how Nixon had attempted to block investigations -- only 58% of adult Americans supported impeachment and a majority of Republicans still supported him. Sometimes, facts can make a difference -- but not to everyone. Think about how you would reason, if the pressure for impeaching Trump mounted further in the weeks to come. What if the taped call with the Ukrainian President was released in full, and it became apparent that Trump did -- or did not -- ask Zelensky for an explicit quid pro quo? Would either fact change your opinion on Trump? Probably not. Chances are you concluded Trump should or should not be impeached long ago -- and you will likely find creative ways of making the facts fit with this conclusion.",0

The BLS data also aren’t perfect at sifting out which employees at big internet firms like Facebook count as “publishing” or “media,” and which don’t. BLS doesn’t release employment data by individual company, so it’s hard to drill deeper into the data for accuracy. Even so, this data gives the most reliable general view of how employment in media has evolved and shifted. How did big media miss the Donald Trump swell? News organizations old and new, large and small, print and online, broadcast and cable assigned phalanxes of reporters armed with the most sophisticated polling data and analysis to cover the presidential campaign. The overwhelming assumption was that the race was Hillary Clinton’s for the taking, and the real question wasn’t how sweeping her November victory would be, but how far out to sea her wave would send political parvenu Trump. Today, it’s Trump who occupies the White House and Clinton who’s drifting out to sea—an outcome that arrived not just as an embarrassment for the press but as an indictment. In some profound way, the election made clear, the national media just doesn’t get the nation it purportedly covers. What went so wrong? What’s still wrong? To some conservatives, Trump’s surprise win on November 8 simply bore out what they had suspected, that the Democrat-infested press was knowingly in the tank for Clinton all along. The media, in this view, was guilty not just of confirmation bias but of complicity. But the knowing-bias charge never added up: No news organization ignored the Clinton emails story, and everybody feasted on the damaging John Podesta email cache that WikiLeaks served up buffet-style. Practically speaking, you’re not pushing Clinton to victory if you’re pantsing her and her party to voters almost daily. The answer to the press’ myopia lies elsewhere, and nobody has produced a better argument for how the national media missed the Trump story than FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver, who pointed out that the ideological clustering in top newsrooms led to groupthink. “As of 2013, only 7 percent of [journalists] identified as Republicans,” Silver wrote in March, chiding the press for its political homogeneity. Just after the election, presidential strategist Steve Bannon savaged the press on the same point but with a heartier vocabulary. “The media bubble is the ultimate symbol of what’s wrong with this country,” Bannon said. “It’s just a circle of people talking to themselves who have no fucking idea what’s going on.” But journalistic groupthink is a symptom, not a cause. And when it comes to the cause, there’s another, blunter way to think about the question than screaming “bias” and “conspiracy,” or counting D’s and R’s. That’s to ask a simple question about the map. Where do journalists work, and how much has that changed in recent years? To determine this, my colleague Tucker Doherty excavated labor statistics and cross-referenced them against voting patterns and Census data to figure out just what the American media landscape looks like, and how much it has changed. The results read like a revelation. The national media really does work in a bubble, something that wasn’t true as recently as 2008. And the bubble is growing more extreme. Concentrated heavily along the coasts, the bubble is both geographic and political. If you’re a working journalist, odds aren’t just that you work in a pro-Clinton county—odds are that you reside in one of the nation’s most pro-Clinton counties. And you’ve got company: If you’re a typical reader of Politico, chances are you’re a citizen of bubbleville, too. The “media bubble” trope might feel overused by critics of journalism who want to sneer at reporters who live in Brooklyn or California and don’t get the “real America” of southern Ohio or rural Kansas. But these numbers suggest it’s no exaggeration: Not only is the bubble real, but it’s more extreme than you might realize. And it’s driven by deep industry trends. Parts of the media have always had their own bubbles. The national magazine industry has been concentrated in New York for generations, and the copy produced reflects an Eastern sensibility. Radio and TV networks based in New York and Los Angeles likewise have shared that dominant sensibility. But they were more than balanced out by the number of newspaper jobs in big cities, midsized cities and smaller towns throughout the country, spreading journalists everywhere. No longer. The newspaper industry has jettisoned hundreds of thousands of jobs, due to falling advertising revenues. Dailies have shrunk sections, pages and features; some have retreated from daily publication; hundreds have closed. Daily and weekly newspaper publishers employed about 455,000 reporters, clerks, salespeople, designers and the like in 1990, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By January 2017, that workforce had more than halved to 173,900. Those losses were felt in almost every region of the country. As newspapers have dwindled, internet publishers have added employees at a bracing clip. According to BLS data, a startling boom in “internet publishing and broadcasting” jobs has taken place. Since January 2008, internet publishing has grown from 77,900 jobs to 206,700 in January 2017. In late 2015, during Barack Obama’s second term, these two trend lines—jobs in newspapers, and jobs in internet publishing—finally crossed. For the first time, the number of workers in internet publishing exceeded the number of their newspaper brethren. Internet publishers are now adding workers at nearly twice the rate newspaper publishers are losing them. This isn’t just a shift in medium. It’s also a shift in sociopolitics, and a radical one. Where newspaper jobs are spread nationwide, internet jobs are not: Today, 73 percent of all internet publishing jobs are concentrated in either the Boston-New York-Washington-Richmond corridor or the West Coast crescent that runs from Seattle to San Diego and on to Phoenix. The Chicagoland area, a traditional media center, captures 5 percent of the jobs, with a paltry 22 percent going to the rest of the country. And almost all the real growth of internet publishing is happening outside the heartland, in just a few urban counties, all places that voted for Clinton. So when your conservative friends use “media” as a synonym for “coastal” and “liberal,” they’re not far off the mark. What caused the majority of national media jobs to concentrate on the coasts? An alignment of the stars? A flocking of like-minded humans? The answer is far more structural, and far more difficult to alter: It was economics that done the deed. The magic of the internet was going to shake up the old certainties of the job market, prevent the coagulation of jobs in the big metro areas, or so the Web utopians promised us in the mid-1990s. The technology would free internet employees to work from wherever they could find a broadband connection. That remains true in theory, with thousands of Web developers, writers and producers working remotely from lesser metropolises. But economists know something the internet evangelists have ignored: All else being equal, specialized industries like to cluster. Car companies didn’t arise in remote regions that needed cars—they arose in Detroit, which already had heavy industry, was near natural resources, boasted a skilled workforce and was home to a network of suppliers that could help car companies thrive. As industries grow, they bud and create spinoffs, the best example being the way Silicon Valley blossomed from just a handful of pioneering electronics firms in the 1960s. Seattle’s rise as a tech powerhouse was seeded by Microsoft, which moved to the area in 1979 and helped create the ecosystem that gave rise to companies like Amazon. As Enrico Moretti, a University of California, Berkeley, economist who has studied the geography of job creation, points out, the tech entrepreneurs who drive internet publishing could locate their companies in low-rent, low-cost-of-living places like Cleveland, but they don’t. They need the most talented workers, who tend to move to the clusters, where demand drives wages higher. And it’s the clusters that host all the subsidiary industries a tech start-up craves—lawyers specializing in intellectual property and incorporation; hardware and software vendors; angel investors; and so on. The old newspaper business model almost prevented this kind of clustering. Except for the national broadsheets—the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, USA Today and increasingly the Washington Post—newspapers must locate, cheek by jowl, next to their customers, the people who consume local news, and whom local advertisers need to reach. The Sioux Falls Argus Leader is stuck in South Dakota just as the owners of hydroelectric plants in the Rockies are stuck where they are. As much as they might want to move their dams to coastal markets where they could charge more for electricity, fate has fixed them geographically. Economists call these “non-tradable goods”—goods that must be consumed in the same community in which they’re made. The business of a newspaper can’t really be separated from the place where it’s published. It is, or was, driven by ads for things that don’t travel, like real estate, jobs, home decor and cars. And as that advertising has gotten harder and harder to come by, local newsrooms have become thinner and thinner. The online media, liberated from printing presses and local ad bases, has been free to form clusters, piggyback-style, on the industries and government that it covers. New York is home to most business coverage because of the size of the business and banking community there. Likewise, national political reporting has concentrated in Washington and grown apace with the federal government. Entertainment and cultural reporting has bunched in New York and Los Angeles, where those businesses are strong. The result? If you look at the maps on the next page, you don’t need to be a Republican campaign strategist to grasp just how far the “media bubble” has drifted from the average American experience. Newspaper jobs are far more evenly scattered across the country, including the deep red parts. But as those vanish, it’s internet jobs that are driving whatever growth there is in media—and those fall almost entirely in places that are dense, blue and right in the bubble. As the votes streamed in on election night, evidence that the country had further cleaved into two Americas became palpable. With few exceptions, Clinton ran the table in urban America, while Trump ran it in the ruralities. And as you might suspect, Clinton dominated where internet publishing jobs abound. Nearly 90 percent of all internet publishing employees work in a county where Clinton won, and 75 percent of them work in a county that she won by more than 30 percentage points. When you add in the shrinking number of newspaper jobs, 72 percent of all internet publishing or newspaper employees work in a county that Clinton won. By this measure, of course, Clinton was the national media’s candidate. Resist—if you can—the conservative reflex to absorb this data and conclude that the media deliberately twists the news in favor of Democrats. Instead, take it the way a social scientist would take it: The people who report, edit, produce and publish news can’t help being affected—deeply affected—by the environment around them. Former New York Times public editor Daniel Okrent got at this when he analyzed the decidedly liberal bent of his newspaper’s staff in a 2004 column that rewards rereading today. The “heart, mind, and habits” of the Times, he wrote, cannot be divorced from the ethos of the cosmopolitan city where it is produced. On such subjects as abortion, gay rights, gun control and environmental regulation, the Times’ news reporting is a pretty good reflection of its region’s dominant predisposition. And yes, a Times-ian ethos flourishes in all of internet publishing’s major cities—Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Seattle, San Francisco and Washington. The Times thinks of itself as a centrist national newspaper, but it’s more accurate to say its politics are perfectly centered on the slices of America that look and think the most like Manhattan. Something akin to the Times ethos thrives in most major national newsrooms found on the Clinton coasts—CNN, CBS, the Washington Post, BuzzFeed, Politico and the rest. Their reporters, an admirable lot, can parachute into Appalachia or the rural Midwest on a monthly basis and still not shake their provincial sensibilities: Reporters tote their bubbles with them. In a sense, the media bubble reflects an established truth about America: The places with money get served better than the places without. People in big media cities aren’t just more liberal, they’re also richer: Half of all newspaper and internet publishing employees work in counties where the median household income is greater than $61,000—$7,000 more than the national median. Commercial media tend to cluster where most of the GDP is created, and that’s the coasts. Perhaps this is what Bannon is hollering about when he denounces the “corporatist, global media,” as he did in February at the Conservative Political Action Conference. If current trends continue—and it’s safe to predict they will—national media will continue to expand and concentrate on the coasts, while local and regional media contract. Can media myopia be cured? Unlike other industries, the national media has a directive beyond just staying in business: Many newsrooms really do feel a commitment to reflecting America fairly. Sometimes, correcting for liberal bias can be smart business as well. For instance, by rightly guessing that there was a big national broadcast audience that didn’t see their worldviews represented in the mainstream networks, the Fox News Channel came to dominate cable TV ratings. Adopting Fox’s anti-mainstream media message to his political needs, Trump ended up running on a Foxesque platform, making a vote for him into a vote against the elite media—his trash talk was always directed at the national press, not the local. Similarly, Breitbart has seen huge success sticking it to liberals, implicitly taking the side of the “real America” against the coastal bubbles. Breitbart now attracts more than 15 million visitors a month, according to comScore, which isn’t far behind more established outlets like the Hill’s 24 million and Politico’s 25 million. But is this really America, either? It’s worth mentioning that Fox and Breitbart—and indeed most of the big conservative media players—also happen to be located in the same bubble. Like the “MSM” they rail against, they’re a product of New York, Washington and Los Angeles. It’s an argument against the bubble, being waged almost entirely by people who work inside it. Is America trapped? Certainly, the media seems to be. It’s hard to imagine an industry willingly accommodating the places with less money, fewer people and less expertise, especially if they sense that niche has already been filled to capacity by Fox. Yet everyone acknowledges that Trump’s election really was a bad miss, and if the media doesn’t figure it out, it will miss the next one, too. Journalism tends toward the autobiographical unless reporters and editors make a determined effort to separate themselves from the frame of their own experiences. The best medicine for journalistic myopia isn’t reeducation camps or a splurge of diversity hiring, though tiny doses of those two remedies wouldn’t hurt. Journalists respond to their failings best when their vanity is punctured with proof that they blew a story that was right in front of them. If the burning humiliation of missing the biggest political story in a generation won’t change newsrooms, nothing will. More than anything, journalists hate getting beat.",0
"A whistleblower complaint has led to concerns President Donald Trump attempted to coerce Ukrainian leaders to investigate a potential political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. That complaint has grown into a scandal: At its heart is a question of whether Trump used the power of his office to attempt to influence a foreign country to meddle in the 2020 election. But while the president has admitted to discussing Biden with Ukraine, he insists — despite no apparent evidence to support this — that there is another, more important scandal to focus on: the former vice president used his office to help the business interests of his son, Hunter Biden. The gist of Trump’s theory: Biden played a role in the removal of Ukraine’s top prosecutor in 2016; Trump, repeating a conspiracy theory popularized by his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, maintains the former vice president did so to protect his son. Biden and the Ukrainian prosecutor, Trump claims, is the “real story” — not a whistleblower’s complaint that Trump improperly used his influence over foreign policy to damage a political rival. The evidence suggests Biden actually may have placed his son in legal danger by advocating for the prosecutor’s removal because he was widely accused of stymying anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine — replacing him could have led to further investigations into a company Hunter Biden had ties to. Trump evidently sees the conspiracy theory as a way to turn the whistleblower’s complaint into electoral gain — perhaps in hopes of saddling the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination with a Benghazi-like scandal that just won’t go away. He has repeatedly misrepresented facts, characterizing the prosecutor who was removed as “tough,” and saying he wants to stop “people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.” Meanwhile, Trump is facing increasing scrutiny from national media, and Democrats say his actions are grounds for impeachment. Hunter Biden joined the board of a Ukrainian company while it was under investigation The facts of this story begin in April 2014, when Hunter Biden joined the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company named Burisma Holdings, shortly after his business partner in an investment and consulting firm, Devon Archer, came aboard. Although Biden had no apparent expertise in the field, he had helped Burisma previously as a consultant with expertise in dealing with multinational regulations, and he was employed at a law firm retained by Burisma’s owner, former Ukrainian government official Mykola Zlochevsky. When Biden joined Burisma’s board, both the company and Zlochevsky were already the subject of intense controversy. Zlochevsky had served as a top official for Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, who was forced out of office in early 2014, in part due to concerns over rampant corruption. Zlochevsky was accused of corruption as well, including for steering large government contracts to companies he owned. One party investigating these allegations was the United Kingdom, because Zlochevsky had $23 million in a British bank account that UK officials believed has been laundered. Britain’s Serious Fraud Office froze that account, and shortly after Yanukovych left office in February 2014, sent a request to Ukrainian officials for documents it believed would help in prove its case. Following this request, the new Ukrainian government began its own investigation into Zlochevsky, looking into whether he embezzled public money. In the midst of these troubles, Hunter Biden accepted a Burisma board seat, and was paid for his trouble, sometimes as much as $50,000 per month. It is unclear what he did for the company. Burisma said at the time that Biden — a lawyer — would be “in charge of” a legal unit. Biden told the New York Times in May 2019 that this was incorrect: “At no time was I in charge of the company’s legal affairs.” Though none of this looks great for the Bidens, it is, unfortunately, routine business in Washington to hire the family members of powerful officials in hopes of gaining influence over public policy. For example, President Jimmy Carter’s brother, Billy; President George W. Bush’s brother, Neil; and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s brothers, Tony and Hugh Rodham were all involved in business interests that once drew concern. Meanwhile, the UK and Ukraine continued to investigate Zlochevsky and other Yanukovych officials, often with the support of the US. But eventually, British investigators began to grow frustrated with what they characterized as a lack of cooperation from their Ukrainian counterparts, saying needed documents weren’t being provided. The US became increasingly involved in the issue, and by December 2014, had sent a letter warning the new government would be forced to face unpleasant consequences if it didn’t do more to aid the UK. That threat went unheeded, and by 2015, British officials were forced to release the frozen funds, which Zlochevsky immediately moved to Cyprus, according to Bloomberg. Joe Biden played a role in pushing out Ukraine’s prosecutor general The part of the story that involves Joe Biden directly centers on the ouster of Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin. In February 2015, Shokin became Ukraine’s prosecutor general, and promised critics of his country’s anti-corruption efforts at home, in the US, and at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that a clean-up was on the way. And he claimed Burisma was in his sights. But Shokin’s deputy, Vitaly Kasko, told Bloomberg that the promise was empty rhetoric. According to Kasko, their office did nothing to pursue its investigation into Zlochevsky throughout 2015, and the office was ineffective at reining in corruption generally, leading him to resign in frustration. Shokin has disputed Kasko’s narrative, but the manner in which he was running his office also concerned the US ambassador to Ukraine, who said publicly in September 2015 that the office was “subverting” the UK’s investigation. Concern at the embassy mounted, and by 2016, officials there began suggesting the Obama administration push for the prosecutor general’s ouster. In particular, the embassy suggested that $1 billion in loan guarantees the country hoped to receive from the US in order to stay solvent should be tied to a tougher anti-corruption strategy that involved removing officials seen as blocking progress, namely Shokin. It wasn’t just the US that wanted Shokin gone, either — many other Western European officials, including the IMF’s then-managing director Christine Lagarde, also insisted Ukraine was doing far too little about corruption. So in March 2016, Biden says he told the Ukrainian government that their loan guarantees would be cut off unless they removed Shokin. He told the story at a session at the Council on Foreign Relations in 2018. “I said, ‘You’re not getting the billion.’ I’m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours,” Biden told his audience. “I looked at them and said: ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you’re not getting the money.’” The former vice president said after the threat, “Well, son of a bitch, he got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.” But though Biden may have taken credit for it, this was hardly his unique idea. “Everyone in the Western community wanted Shokin sacked,” Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told the Wall Street Journal. “The whole G-7, the IMF, the EBRD, everybody was united that Shokin must go, and the spokesman for this was Joe Biden.” The people of Ukraine wanted Shokin gone as well, and demonstrated for his removal around the time of Biden’s threat. Shortly after that demonstration, Shokin was dismissed. Trump hopes to distract from the whistleblower by pushing a conspiracy theory Trump and his allies have asserted — without any evidence — that Biden’s ouster of Shokin was itself corrupt, and specifically that it was aimed at protecting Hunter and Burisma from a corruption investigation led by Shokin. Trump has tweeted the Bidens are “stone cold Crooked.” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has called concerns over the whistleblower’s complaint as a Democratic scheme fool the public into ignoring “what Biden was doing.” And Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has said he wants the Justice Department to “look at the Biden-Ukraine connection, like we looked at the Trump-Russia connection.” Biden spokesperson Kate Bedingfield said all this is nonsense, and that Biden pushed to oust Shokin “without any regard for how it would or would not impact any business interests of his son, a private citizen.” Biden himself blasted Trump’s efforts to discredit him at the Iowa Democrats’ Steak Fry over the weekend, calling the president’s actions on the phone call “an overwhelming abuse of power.” “Trump’s doing this because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum,” Biden said. “And he’s using the abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try to do something to smear me.” And despite his boast last year, Biden seem to have played a very minor role in Shokin’s firing. With the Obama administration, the idea to remove him came from the US’s embassy in Ukraine, and the sentiment the prosecutor was hindering anti-corruption efforts was shared by the US’s partners and Ukrainian citizens. Too, removing Shokin has the potential to hurt Hunter Biden given the US had him replaced in order to ensure someone more fully committed to pursuing an anti-corruption agenda — including an investigation into the former Ukraine official Mykola Zlochevsky — was installed. Rudy Giuliani has long claimed that these points aside, Biden did indeed do something wrong. Giuliani told the New Yorker that he has talked with Shokin, and that Shokin insists he was seriously investigating Burisma before he was fired. Shokin made the same claim to Ukrainian news agency Strana shortly after his firing. The question of whether Shokin’s investigation against Burisma was in fact a serious one is disputed, however. His deputy has said it was not, as have US officials based in Ukraine; and according the New York Times, some US and Ukrainian officials believe the former prosecutor was pantomiming an investigation in effort to solicit a bribe from Zlochevsky. In any case, Ukraine has a new president now: Volodymyr Zelensky, who has also promised to stamp out corruption. And it was in a call with him that Trump reportedly urged him to investigate Joe Biden and Burisma, which he calls the “real story.” Trump has now taken that call public, and some Republican allies now hope to launch a domestic investigation. In doing so, he has created a counternarrative to combat questions of whether he committed an impeachment offense in his call with Zelensky, albeit one whose effectiveness — particularly given the facts of Biden’s limited interaction with Ukraine — remains to be seen.

"The White House will not participate in Congress' ongoing impeachment inquiry, it said Tuesday, stepping up a political and legal standoff between the executive and legislative branches of government. In a blistering eight-page letter to Democratic congressional leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, White House counsel Pat Cipollone repeatedly mocked the Democrats' process. It ""lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation"" and is simply an effort to ""nullify the outcome of the democratic process"" by reversing the outcome of the 2016 election and influence the upcoming 2020 election, he wrote. Moreover, Cipollone argued that because there has been no formal vote to begin an impeachment inquiry, there is no official process underway and accordingly the administration is not required to comply. In a fiery response, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the letter ""manifestly wrong."" ""The White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the President's abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction,"" she said in a statement Tuesday night. ""Mr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable."" Pelosi has said that an official vote is not necessary under House rules and the relevant House committees can continue their investigations under a banner of impeachment. The president and the speaker have been trading arguments over these process questions since Friday, when Trump said he would memorialize his objections in the letter unveiled on Tuesday.Now the White House has made clear that it believes no vote in the House means Republicans are being denied investigative and other powers to defend the president. ""Given that your inquiry lacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections, the executive branch cannot be expected to participate in it,"" Cipollone wrote. ""Because participating in this inquiry under the current unconstitutional posture would inflict lasting institutional harm on the executive branch and lasting damage to the separation of powers, you have left the president no choice."" Translation: no documents and no witnesses. On a conference call with reporters, however, a senior administration official would not commit to cooperating with Democrats even if there were a formal vote. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who has repeatedly drawn Trump's ire, tweeted that the letter shows that the White House thinks Trump ""is above the law"" but that ""The Constitution says otherwise."" The ambassador who wasn't there The release of the letter followed the Trump administration's order blocking Gordon Sondland — the U.S. ambassador to the European Union — from testifying before Congress. Trump wrote on Twitter that he wasn't going to subject Sondland to questions from a ""kangaroo court,"" an allusion to what he called the unfairness of the process. Congressional Democrats want answers about Sondland's and others' participation in the growing scandal over Ukraine and Trump's pressure on a foreign government to investigate his potential 2020 rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Later on Tuesday, House Democrats issued a subpoena to Sondland compelling him to testify next Wednesday, October 16, and produce requisite documents. In a statement, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said that the effort by Democrats is ""purely political"" and ""ignores the fundamental rights guaranteed to every American."" ""These partisan proceedings are an affront to the Constitution—as they are being held behind closed doors and deny the president the right to call witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses, to have access to evidence, and many other basic rights,"" Grisham said.

"Turkish forces began crossing the Syrian border on Wednesday, launching an operation in Kurdish-dominated areas of the country's north, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced. The Turkish offensive jeopardizes Kurdish-led forces who have been a key U.S. ally in the bloody fight against ISIS. Turkey says those same forces are linked to militant groups who stage attacks in a separatist movement against the Turkish government. Late Sunday, the White House abruptly announced it was pulling troops away from the border and that Turkey planned to launched an offensive — a major shift in U.S. policy that followed a phone call between President Trump and Erdogan. Senior officials have said they were not consulted or informed about the change. On Wednesday afternoon, Trump said in a White House statement, ""The United States did not endorse this attack and has made it clear to Turkey that this operation is a bad idea."" He added, ""There are no American soldiers in the area."" Airstrikes have reportedly hit in or near Kobane, just south of the Turkish-Syria border. A U.S. military official in Syria tells NPR's Tom Bowman that U.S. troops are also near Kobane, but the airstrikes are to the west of where U.S. troops are located. The official adds that they believe the offensive will both spread and intensify overnight into Thursday, likely encompassing the entire border. Trump said that Turkey has promised to protect civilians and religious minorities, but his statement did not specifically mention the Kurds. And he said Turkey has also promised to hold the line on ISIS. ""Turkey is now responsible for ensuring all ISIS fighters being held captive remain in prison and that ISIS does not reconstitute in any way, shape or form,"" Trump stated. The European Union and other U.S. allies are warning that the incursion — and the displacement of Kurdish fighters — could provide fertile ground for the resurgence of ISIS. The EU said Wednesday that it ""calls on Turkey to cease the unilateral military action."" Just before Turkey launched its attack, there were reports of ISIS attacks against Kurdish forces in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, which was previously the de facto capital of ISIS' so-called caliphate. The Turkish military is working with the Syrian National Army, Erdogan said, adding that they are targeting Kurdish fighters as well as ISIS extremists. ""Our mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area,"" Erdogan said. Ahead of the operation, Turkish soldiers used heavy equipment to remove a section of concrete border wall so that troops could cross, an official told Reuters. A U.S. military official in Syria tells Bowman that the Turkish airstrikes are ""more expansive than shaping a limited incursion."" The U.S. is tracking people who are being displaced from the Syrian cities of Ras al-Ayn, Tal Abyad, Qamishli and Ain Issa, the official says, reflecting a span of some 140 miles along the north and northeastern border. The official said that they are expecting possible Turkish ground movement. On Tuesday, Turkey reportedly struck the Syrian-Iraqi border to keep Kurdish forces from using it as a conduit to reinforce their positions, the news agency said. Earlier, Islamic State militants reportedly carried out an attack on the city of Raqqa in northern Syria, including a post manned by U.S.-backed Kurdish-led fighters. More than 3 million Syrian refugees are registered in Turkey, having fled brutal conditions imposed by both ISIS and their country's civil war. Erdogan said Wednesday that the long-anticipated offensive aims to establish ""a safe zone, facilitating the return of Syrian refugees to their homes."" The operation is causing fear among the U.S.'s Kurdish allies. Mustafa Bali, a spokesperson for the Kurdish-led forces, said: ""Turkish warplanes have started to carry out airstrikes on civilian areas. There is a huge panic among people of the region."" The White House decision to abandon posts along the border and give Turkey a free hand in taking on Kurdish groups has sparked a sharp bipartisan backlash in Washington. Brett McGurk, who was Trump's special envoy for the fight against ISIS, also decried the decision in an interview with NPR. ""Presidents do a lot of things, but the most consequential are decisions of war and peace like this, and you can't make decisions on a haphazard basis after a single call with a foreign leader,"" McGurk said. ""This is almost unprecedented."" Jens Stoltenberg, NATO's Secretary General, said via Twitter: ""I count on Turkey to act with restraint & ensure that the gains we have made in the fight against ISIS are not jeopardised."" Human rights groups such as Amnesty International are also urging Turkey's military to act with restraint and ensure civilians' safety. ""Turkey has an obligation under international humanitarian law to take all possible measures to protect civilians and to ensure they have access to humanitarian aid,"" Amnesty International's Middle East Research Director Lynn Maalouf said in a statement. ""Civilians wishing to flee the fighting must be given safe passage to do so."" Earlier this week, Trump appeared to warn Turkey against doing anything ""off limits."" He said, ""if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey."" U.S. forces in this area of Syria have assisted Kurdish allies with keeping ISIS fighters detained. And there are concerns about what will happen to those ISIS fighters now that the U.S. is stepping back. ""The Kurdish forces have always been clear that their number one concern is not ISIS but is protecting their territory from Turkey,"" NPR's Hannah Allam reported. ""So if they're moving into a defensive position, who's going to watch the ISIS prisoners guard the detention camp?""",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican chairmen of two U.S. Senate committees have asked the Treasury Department, in a letter, for possible reports of money laundering or fraud on the business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden’s son with a Ukraine energy firm. The letter, seen by Reuters on Friday, seeks “suspicious activity reports,” or documents that financial institutions file with the department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network when a case of money laundering or fraud is suspected. It was unclear if any such reports exist regarding Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son. There letter gave no evidence that Hunter Biden engaged in suspicious activity that would have been covered by such reports. [tmsnrt.rs/2s6ZdoF] The agency does not comment on the reports, a spokesman said. Fincen, as the network is known, collects more than 2 million such reports each year, and they are tipsheets that make no findings on whether illegal activity has occurred. The request comes as Republicans seek to defend President Donald Trump against a Democrat-led impeachment probe into whether the president improperly pressured Ukraine to investigate the Bidens to improve his chances of re-election. Republicans in Congress have tried to turn the impeachment inquiry into an investigation of Hunter Biden - repeating unverified accusations about his work in Ukraine. Joe Biden’s campaign criticized the request as a political effort to attack Biden in the wake of damaging impeachment hearings. “Trump is now counting on his Republican enablers in the Senate to bail him out,” campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said. “Driven by fear of a mean tweet, they are falling in line, peddling the same disproven lies we’ve heard for months.” Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson, chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, sent the request in a Nov. 15 letter to Ken Blanco, the director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. The chairmen set a Dec. 5 deadline for information related to Hunter Biden, who was on the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, which had been under investigation in Ukraine. In the letter, the senators said Burisma was paying Hunter Biden as much as $50,000 a month and their panels were investigating “potentially improper actions by the Obama administration with respect to Burisma Holdings and Ukraine.” Grassley and Johnson, citing a story by a reporter with conservative ties, said Burisma’s consulting firm Blue Star Strategies used Biden’s board membership to gain access to Obama administration officials at the State Department. The Bidens have denied any wrongdoing. The elder Biden is a leading Democratic candidate for president in next year’s U.S. elections, in which Trump is seeking a second four-year term. Grassley and Johnson also said on Friday they had asked the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration for records of 2016 White House meetings between Obama administration officials, Ukrainian government representatives and officials of the Democratic National Committee. Trump and Republicans in Congress have been ramping up their rhetoric on the Bidens as the November 2020 U.S. elections near and as Democrats in the House of Representatives intensify their impeachment investigation of Trump. Democrats are looking into whether Trump used the withholding of U.S. aid to Ukraine as leverage to press Kiev to launch investigations into the Bidens and allegations Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. elections to hurt the Trump campaign. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded it was Russia that tried to influence the 2016 election in favor of Trump. On Thursday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, an ally of Trump’s, wrote to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting documents related to 2016 contacts between the Bidens, other Obama administration officials and former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Trump has denied doing anything improper in Ukraine and has called the impeachment inquiry a witch hunt. ",0
"Never before in the history of this country has the racial and ethnic makeup of the older generation differed so greatly from the demographic makeup of the younger population. In 1975, 13 percent of adults over 65 and 25 percent of youth under 18 were people of color; that's a racial generation gap of 12 percentage points. By 2015, 22 percent of adults over 65 and 48 percent of youth were people of color; that's a gap of 26 percentage points. ""OK boomer,"" love it or hate it, denies this demographic reality. We're not revisiting an age-old generational conflict here. The racial generation gap is a much bigger story. Those who fail to understand and address the interplay between race and age will fail to understand today's political landscape and miss a big chance to build alliances across racial and generational divides. 2016 marked the ""most demographically divisive election in the past 36 years,"" with parties more divided by age, race and education than in any prior election in modern political history, according to a recent report from the Brookings Institution and the Center for American Progress. And 2020 won't be much different unless candidates dig deeper to understand the nuances of race and age. In the Democratic primary, news outlets and debate moderators are focusing almost exclusively on the candidates' ages. After all, the youngest and oldest candidates span about a 40-year generation gap. This, however, fails to consider the interplay between race and age. When ""the Squad,"" the group of four millennial and Gen X women of color in the House of Representatives, endorsed Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the candidates missed an opportunity to clearly and emphatically state their commitments to building intergenerational, multiracial alliances. Sanders' aides got halfway there by describing how Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement ""represents the multiracial, working-class coalition he is trying to build,"" but it was the congresswoman who called on activists to ""push towards a positive and inclusive movement"" that is ""intergenerational but progressive."" Last month, an internal Pete Buttigieg campaign memo raised concerns that the mayor's sexuality was an issue for African American voters in South Carolina. Was the issue homophobia in the black community, as many presumed? Unlikely. Data from the Public Religion Research Institute points the finger at a generational divide. There is a nearly 20 percentage point gap between younger and older Americans on support for laws protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination. That generational gap holds for both whites and African Americans. However, the Buttigieg campaign and the reporters covering it failed to see how race and age interact—and instead treated African Americans as a monolith. Had the campaign recognized they had a legitimate ""OK boomer"" issue on their hands, they could have crafted an appeal to all of Buttigieg's younger supporters, asking them to talk to their parents and older relatives about the mayor's merits. Reporters and politicians must combine data sources to better examine the interplay of race and age. When looking at data about the voting patterns or political interests of a racial or ethnic group, they can break it down across age groups. Similarly, with data about a specific age group, they can break it down across race and ethnicity. It's also important to highlight examples of multigenerational, multiracial alliances. Reverend William Barber, president emeritus of the North Carolina NAACP and a leader of the Forward Justice strategy center, consistently describes his work as building a ""multi-generational and multi-racial movement."" In speaking directly to organizations with older memberships, like the NAACP, Barber has said he encourages changes that bridge racial and generational divides. ""Young people are not just pushed aside to hand out flyers for the movement, but are key to the foundational structure of it,"" he told Occupy.com. ""Don't expect them to stick around for a meeting where you decide who the officers are and what color the napkins will be at a banquet."" We are living in an unprecedented time of demographic change, where analyses of generational divides must include the new racial landscape—and vice versa. Without attending to the interplay between race and age, we can't hope to understand the racial generation gap. Doing so is necessary to develop alliances and coalitions that effectively bridge these differences.",0
