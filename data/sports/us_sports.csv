4,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Clemson has parted ways with men's basketball assistant coach Steve Smith after his voice was heard on a federal wiretap involving defendant Christian Dawkins on the ongoing trial into college corruption.The video from 2017 included Smith commenting about why Clemson's football team is so successful and Dawkins telling Smith he could help get cash to the family of ex-Duke star Zion Williamson if he had chosen to attend Clemson.University officials said Friday that Clemson would not renew Smith's contract that expired last month.Clemson basketball coach Brad Brownell said he supports the decision to let his seven-year assistant go.Smith was scheduled to have his contract renewed at a board of trustees meeting last week until he was heard in court talking with Dawkins and an undercover FBI agent about several things, including why Clemson's national championship football program is so successful.Smith said in the July 2017 video ""if you do it and use resources at Clemson, like you can really keep everything tight.""Later in the video, Smith said, ""It's a small college town. You can come to a game one night, after the game, you seed a dude out there in a nice looking suit, you like, 'wait a minute now.'""Testimony from financial adviser Marty Blazer indicated he believed that meant boosters would give players improper benefits.Dawkins and amateur basketball coach, Merl Code Jr., are charged with paying bribes to assistant basketball coaches to help secure NBA-bound players as customers.

Manziel, 26, not only played at Texas A&M but attended high school in Kerrville, Texas, which is some 65 miles from San Antonio. So it would be a virtual homecoming for one of the most exciting and controversial quarterbacks in recent memory.UPDATE: USA Today is reporting that AAF chairman Tom Dundon has confirmed that the league has offered Manziel an opportunity work out for its teams. Though San Antonio owns Manziel’s territorial rights, all eight teams would be present to watch him work out.The circumstances of Manziel’s release by the Alouettes are still murky, with the only thing we know for sure that he violated his contract in some way.

12,"Buffalo Bills quarterback AJ McCarron said the game was ""the most fun I've ever had"" on a football field -- and he won a state championship at St. Paul's and three BCS national-championships at Alabama.On Thursday night in the Bills' preseason finale, McCarron rallied Buffalo from a 24-point deficit in the fourth quarter with three touchdown passes and a TD run in a 28-27 victory over the Chicago Bears.McCarron and Buffalo's offense came out of the two-minute warning facing a fourth-and-22 at the Bills 4-yard line and took the lead when McCarron threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Keith Towbridge with 13 seconds to play.""Had a feeling, just one of those feelings you can't explain,"" McCarron said about the last drive. ""I looked at the guys -- (rookie guard) Wyatt (Teller)'s who I remember the most, just because of the look on his face. It was like he'd never heard it before -- but I looked at the group and told them, 'Watch this. It's going to be legendary.' First, I said, 'Watch this. We're going to go down and win. You're going to remember this for a long time,' and I said, 'This is going to be legendary for us,' for our group in the final game together. It's part of the business, not knowing who'll be here tomorrow.""I'm just super proud of the guys. It was just awesome to battle with them. Probably the most fun I've ever had.""NFL teams can have as many as 90 players on their rosters during the preseason. But the Bills will have to reduce that number to 53 by 3 p.m. CDT Saturday to meet the regular-season limit.Buffalo sidelined most of its projected starters for the preseason finale. McCarron got together with the players who were going to play against the Bears in a meeting on Wednesday night.""Some of the guys that played today, it's no secret, me, anybody, we might not be here tomorrow or whenever they make the final cuts,"" McCarron said after Thursday night's game. ""I just wanted everybody to know that they were special to me. We've been through a long process to get here, and I wanted to take that upon myself to show them my gratitude to them and what it means to me for them to be out here every day working hard.""McCarron started Buffalo's second preseason game on Aug. 17. But he suffered a shoulder injury -- initially reported as a broken collarbone -- in the first quarter and missed the Aug. 26 game against the Cincinnati Bengals.It took McCarron and the Bills' offense a while to get going against the Bears. Chicago carried a 27-3 lead into the final period, and the Bears ran back an interception for one of their touchdowns.""First half, being a little rusty from being out a week, from not practicing, I couldn't get things to go our way,"" McCarron said. ""And we just had some unlucky bounces.""But it was just awesome. We're blessed to be able to play this game for a living. It's a game that we get paid handsomely at and it's fun and I love being part of this team and I loved being out there being able to battle with the guys. It was awesome.""McCarron entered training camp competing with Nathan Peterman and Josh Allen for the Bills' No. 1 QB job. With McCarron out, Allen, the seventh player picked in April's draft, started the third preseason game. Peterman started the preseason opener.The Bills' decision to let McCarron play the entire preseason finale while Peterman and Allen sat seemed parsed in every possible way by Buffalo followers. But after the game, Bills coach Sean McDermott said he hadn't decided who will be Buffalo's starting quarterback in its regular-season opener against the Baltimore Ravens on Sept. 9, and he said McCarron ""absolutely"" remained in the competition.""I'm enjoying this game,"" McCarron said when asked about the team's quarterback situation. ""I understand y'all want to talk about the QB competition, but I'm enjoying this.""One of the reasons, McCarron said, was the collection of second- and third-teamers that pulled off the comeback.""It's just a good group of guys,"" McCarron said. ""It's awesome to be a part of them. It's fun to play the game with guys that just love playing, love being part of a group, love being out there with you.

13,"NCAA Football: Michigan at Ohio StateWhat is the story behind Ohio State's Buckeye nickname and mascot? (Photo, USA Sports)BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- Our state has one university with a Crimson Tide nickname alongside an elephant mascot and another college with both an eagle and a tiger.So, we may not be the best fan base to ask this question, but:Just what exactly is a buckeye and why is it Ohio State's mascot?In preparation for Monday night's national championship game between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Oregon Ducks (more on that in another story), it seems appropriate to clear the confusion up.According to folklore, the Buckeye resembles the eye of a deer and carrying one brings good luck. It has been the official Ohio State nickname since 1950, the website says, but it had been in common use for many years before that.The website also clarifies the use of that strange leaf on Ohio State players' helmets: ""A round white decal, about the size of a quarter, with a green depiction of a buckeye leaf is applied to Ohio State football helmets for big plays and consistency on the field. This tradition started in 1967 when Woody Hayes and longtime trainer Ernie Biggs changed the look of the Ohio State uniforms.""The nickname is also used for the team's mascot, Brutus Buckeye, who is (basically) a giant nut.To make sure I got it right, I asked my dear Ohio friend Sue Combs for some clarification about the nickname and mascot.Her mother, a 1949 graduate of Ohio State who passed away in November, often explained to her the importance of the buckeye.""She hated it when neighbors in Tennessee used to ask about the Buckeye. They would tease about it being a worthless nut,"" Combs said. ""She used to say you might not be able to 'eat' a Buckeye, but it is said to bring about lucky powers to the person who carries one.""And Brutus Buckeye?""Brutus is full of vim and vigor and and luck,"" she said.",0.0
14,"The number of underclassmen who enter the NFL draft only to go unselected is troubling to many around college football, Nick Saban included.This year, 149 underclassmen entered the draft, but 44 went unselected. With no mechanism in place to allow them to return to school (such as exists in college basketball), their football careers might well be over.But should college football adopt a similar policy to college basketball? Is it even feasible?Saban was asked that very question when he met with the media prior to his annual keynote address for the Team Focus fundraiser in Mobile on Wednesday night. He seemed skeptical it would work, for several reasons:For one thing, basketball has only 13 scholarship players, rather than 85 in football.For another, the two sports’ offseason and recruiting calendars are completely different. Basketball players can enter the draft and return to their teams (if undrafted) without so much as missing a class or an offseason workout. And most basketball signings take place in November, before the season begins.In football, national signing day takes place in either December or February. The NFL early entry deadline is in mid-January. Should a player enter the draft, but go undrafted and choose to return to school, he might have already been replaced on the roster.“If we’re going to have this many people go out for the draft, that’s obviously a solution that some people should look at,” Saban said. “If that were the case in football, how many guys would go out for the draft? You could kiss spring practice goodbye. You wouldn’t know what kind of team … or who would be on your team for the next year. How would you know how many guys you could recruit if you don’t know how many guys are coming back to the team? I think when you have smaller numbers (as in basketball), that’s a little easier to manage.”10Nick Saban and Team FocusSaban also raised concerns about the number of underclassmen who entered the draft, even those who went in the later rounds. In many cases, they’re not putting themselves in the best situation to succeed long-term even if they are drafted in the sixth or seventh round, he said.“… Every coach I know is all about the players,” Saban said. “They want what is best for the players. When you have 140-some guys going out for the draft and 49 don’t get drafted, and a significant number get drafted in the last couple of rounds from that group, which means they probably won’t be on the squad in three years, you’ve got a lot of people with failed careers and no degrees. And that’s not really a combination for them and their success in the future.”It was another banner year for Alabama in the NFL draft, with 10 players selected, three in the first round. The Crimson Tide now has 29 first-round picks during Saban’s tenure, a significantly higher total than the number of game losses the program has suffered in that time (21).As always, however, Saban remains process-oriented. Getting drafted is only the beginning of success in football, he said.“I’m really happy for our players,” Saban said. “I know it’s their dream to play at the next level. We’re very proud of the fact that we’ve had 32 guys drafted in the last three years, 22 in the last two years, and 10 this year. We wish those guys well. We want every guy in our program to get drafted as high as possible. We have some guys who have some great opportunities and we wish them well.“I think the one thing that sometimes players don’t look at — they think about getting drafted, getting drafted, getting drafted. But that’s just the starting point. The No. 1 thing to be focused on is, what do I need to do to have a great career and play for as long as possible and be the best player I can be? Things will always work out if you can do that.”Here are Saban’s thoughts on some other topics:• His surgically repaired hip: “It’s great, really good. I always say they don’t make them like they used to, and there’s not many of us left. We’ve had some good medical care, great rehab, and I certainly appreciate all the thoughts and prayers, and that so many people have talked to me about that. We’re thankful for that.”• Alabama’s Academic Progress Rate score, which was second-highest in the SEC behind only Vanderbilt: “I think that’s one of the goals of the program is for our guys to have a chance to be more successful as people. And a big part of that is that they put a lot of value themselves into graduating from school. I’m very proud that we’re one of the top teams in the conference in graduation rate and overall APR and all those types of things. We have a lot of people who do a really good job that are part of our team to make that happen.”• NCAA rule changes, including shortening overtime and tweaking targeting fouls: “I think they’re all good rules. Most of them are all about player safety. I think that’s something that’s got to be really important to all of us in the game right now. I think they will be really positive.”• The recovery of injured cornerback Jalyn Armour-Davis: “Jalyn’s got some medical issues now that he’s going to have to work through over the summer, but he’s certainly an outstanding athlete, a conscientious guy. He missed most of last year due to injury and was not able to participate in spring practice due to injury, but hopefully we can get him healthy and he can develop from there.”• Team Focus, a mentoring program founded by former college football coach and TV analyst Mike Gottfried: “I think that what Mike has done is really unique, the leadership he’s shown and the example that he’s set for so many of us to try to do something and help young people. For him to try and create a family situation for some of these guys to look up to and have a chance to be successful in life, I think is really special.”• On what might be on the agenda at this month’s SEC spring meetings: “I think probably everybody is concerned about roster management, with all the transfers, graduate transfers. Guys go out early for the draft, so it’s very difficult for some of us to manage the 85 (scholarships). Maybe we need to talk about some of the things we can to do help with those problems.”• What he meant when he said his team lost the ‘Alabama factor’ vs. Clemson: “I think that we’ve always tried to have a team that played with a lot of discipline, very responsible and accountable and do their job at a very high level on a consistent basis. Everybody’s got to put the team first. It’s my responsibility, but the way we finished the season, I wondered about some of those things. Whether it was people worried about outcomes or losing our humility because we’d won so many games — I don’t know. We played against a really good team and got exposed, and we didn’t play our best. You always want to play your best in big games. As a coach, I’m disappointed in the job I did to help our players do that.”On why more 5-star recruits seems to succeed at Alabama than at other schools: “I don’t know. I think what it indicates is that we do a really good job of developing players. We recruit a lot of really good players and we have a lot of good players. I think the key to the drill is, how do we get those guys to play as well as possible, for their benefit, for our benefit, for their future. We try to create value with our players in personal development, academic development, career development, and see if they can develop careers as football players. So we kind of look at it from a holistic standpoint, and I think guys become more responsible and accountable when you develop a culture of accountability around them. Being responsible for your own self-determination is what being a professional is. Someone is always going to define expectations from a standpoint of what you’re supposed to do and when you’re supposed to it, whether you’re playing for the New York Giants of working for Apple Computers. And we’re going to have guys do both. So we want to teach some things that are going to help them be successful when it comes to some of the values that really create opportunities for them.”",0.0

17,"What about Mason Rudolph?The NFL swiftly brought the hammer down on Myles Garrett and other key participants from the Brawl by the Lake on Thursday night in Cleveland, and there’s no argument with the severity of the punishments.Garrett, Cleveland’s star defensive end, is banned for at least the rest of the season for wielding Rudolph’s helmet as a weapon. He didn’t just cross the line. He obliterated it. Thankfully, it didn’t result in a cracked skull or even worse for the Steelers quarterback.Maurkice Pouncey deserved the three-game suspension, too, for kicking Garrett. His assertion that he “blacked out” after seeing his quarterback attacked doesn’t cut it. He lost his cool and piled on. I mean, Rudolph was under siege all night by the Browns' pass rush (four sacks, 11 QB hits) and nobody blacked out.And Browns D-tackle Larry Ogunjobi’s one-game suspension seems fair enough for shoving Rudolph to the turf as an additional indignation.But let’s not pretend that Rudolph didn’t have a role in this that needs to be called out.No, Rudolph didn’t deserve to be smacked in the head with his own helmet – even after his boneheaded decision to charge Garrett while not wearing a helmet as his teammate, guard David DeCastro, was defusing the situation by restraining Garrett.The Steelers quarterback, though, should be disciplined for inflaming the matter. Replays showed rather clearly that after Garrett took him to the turf, Rudolph briefly tried to grasp the defensive end in the head and neck area and even attempted to remove Garrett’s helmet. It was after that when Garrett retaliated by yanking Rudolph’s helmet off, leading to the ugliest part of the incident.The NFL, which has traditionally taken a hard-line stance against fighting – players who left the bench areas to join the fracas are subject to discipline, probably fines -- can see the video, too. It shows Rudolph seemingly kicking Garrett in the groin area.So often the party that retaliates gets the worst end of the discipline. In this case, that’s fair, since Garrett basically assaulted Rudolph with a weapon. But Garrett’s punishment doesn’t totally absolve Rudolph, who helped ignite an on-field riot in a league that is violent enough.Asked after the game what sparked the incident, Rudolph said, “I got sacked, we exchanged some words, he kept keeping on and one thing led to another. You can go back and watch the tape if you want and make your own assumptions.”Frown on fighting, NFL? Well, show just how much by sending a message that makes Rudolph accountable, too. He had a role in the shocking incident that stains the Shield. If not a minimal, Ogunjobi-like suspension, then he should be penalized with a fine.Maybe that’s yet to happen as the league contemplates some of the remaining discipline that it has pledged. But he shouldn’t get off scot-free just because getting hit with his own helmet provided the shock-value image no one wants to see.Why in the world would Rudolph charge after Garrett without his helmet?“I felt like I had a bone to pick with him after what he did,” Rudolph said. “I wasn’t going to back down. I appreciate the offensive line always having my back and putting it to bed, but I was angry. I’m human.”I’m wondering what he might have done if he had managed to rip Garrett's helmet off, rather than vice-versa. In any event, he readily admitted that even as stupid as it was to go after Garrett while not wearing a helmet, he charged on with his own ill-advised intentions in mind.Rudolph came across as rather smug during his postgame news conference, when he blasted Garrett as a “coward” and deemed the actions as “bush league.” But he was honest enough to admit that he had “a bone to pick” with Garrett, which in layman’s terms means “fight.”The NFL shouldn't turn a blind eye to that. Another shoe needs to drop.DeCastro – who kept a cool head and tried to defuse the situation until Garrett swung the helmet – maintained that he wasn’t sure what started the incident.It’s unclear whether Garrett knew Rudolph had already released a pass as he took him to the turf.“Things got chippy at the end,” DeCastro told reporters. “He laid on him too long and Mason approached him. Who knows? You know what I mean? It was back and forth and all of a sudden, Mason’s helmet is off and getting swung at his head. I mean, that’s just reckless.”Reckless sums it up, but in more ways than one.",0.0

Tyler Sinclair, a spokesperson for the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office, added that any investigation into the incident would have to be initiated at the city level.""Could that be charged as a crime?

I think they expect the NFL will come down hard and the victim is not calling for a prosecution, so I think this is the proper way to deal with it.""Athletes don’t often face criminal charges for on-the-field incidents, but it has happened in the NHL and NBA. In 2004, the Detroit Pistons and Indiana Pacers got into a melee that involved players and fans. Five Pacers were charged with misdemeanors and pleaded no contest.Also in 2004, former Canucks forward Todd Bertuzzi was charged with criminal assault in Vancouver for an attack against Steven Moore. He pleaded guilty and received probation, plus community service.Kelly, a former assistant U.S. attorney and former executive director of the NHL Players Association, represented Boston Bruins enforcer Marty McSorley in 2000 when he was charged by Canadian authorities for an in-game assault with a hockey stick on Canucks wing Donald Brashear.Kelly said the NHL lobbied for the Canadian court not to prosecute McSorley. The court went ahead and found him guilty -- he received 18 months probation. Kelly said McSorley’s NHL-mandated year-long suspension, which ended his career, was far more significant than the punishment he received from the court.“It’s so difficult to prove intent – that’s the first part,” said Cornell University visiting law professor Michael L. Huyghue. “And the second part is that professional athletes assume a greater degree of risk than an average citizen.""Rudolph, who was able to talk about the play after Thursday's game, would have the option of filing a civil suit against Garrett. Huyghue, who has previously worked for the NFL, the Detroit Lions and Jacksonville Jaguars, doesn’t think that will happen.“There’s a macho aspect to this,” Huyghue said. “The quarterback is going to say, 'I’m not going to back down.' You are expected to be a tough guy ... and to go out and sue someone would be a contradiction of those terms.""The firm representing Rudolph, Younger & Associates/QB Limited, tweeted that Garrett’s actions “cannot be defended by reasonable mind,"" and added: ""There are many risks an NFL QB assumes with every snap taken on the field. Being hit on your uncovered head by a helmet being swung by a 275-lb DE is not one of them. Tonight could have had a catastrophic ending. The matter will be reviewed thoroughly.”University of Miami law professor Tamara Lave said she would be “astonished” if the local prosecutor charged Garrett, but less surprised if the prosecutor would charge a visiting player in these circumstances. “At the end of the day, the question is whether the prosecutor can get a conviction,” Lave said. “Does the prosecutor believe they can get 12 members of the community to convict a star football player for hitting the rival’s head with a helmet? I don’t think they do. So they aren’t going to file it.”Contributing: Tom Schad",0.0
20,"PHOENIX — The game is still played with the pitchers’ mound 60 feet, 6 inches from home plate, the bases 90 feet apart, three outs per half inning and nine innings in a regulation game.Those are about the only constants resembling the game of baseball as we once knew itChicago Cubs manager Joe Maddon is the latest to express his fury at the baseball gods, but he’s at a decided disadvantage as opposed to the rest of disgruntled baseball lifers across the nation.He is required to sit and watch these games.But as for the likes of Hall of Fame pitcher Goose Gossage, all-time hit king Pete Rose, and former World Series champion manager Lou Piniella, they certainly have a choice.They can change the channel.“I can’t watch these games anymore,’’ Gossage said. “It’s not baseball. It’s unwatchable. A lot of the strategy of the game, the beauty of the game, it’s all gone.“It’s like a video game now. It’s home run derby with their (expletive) launch angle every night.’’And if the changes to the way the game is played – more home runs, shifts, strikeouts – weren’t startling enough, Major League Baseball is experimenting with new technology and drastic rule changes in the independent Atlantic League, namely using an automated system to call balls and strikes.These trials in the Atlantic League are part of a larger shift in the game. A new era of analytical baseball, where everything is measured, quantified and optimized by raw, heartless numbers.There’s more knowledge and information than ever before, which is relished in the industry, but critics say it’s sucked the heart and soul out of the game.“All anybody wants to do is launch the ball,’’ Piniella said. “They’re making the ballparks smaller, the balls tighter, and all we’re seeing is home runs.“There are no hit-and-runs. No stolen bases. Nothing.“I managed 3,400 games in the big leagues, and never once did I put on a full shift on anybody. Not once. And I think I won a few games without having to shift.’’Said Rose, who produced 4,256 hits and struck out 100 times only once in 24 seasons: “It’s home run derby every night, and if that’s what they want, that’s what they’re going to get. But they have to understand something ... Home runs are up. Strikeouts are up. But attendance is down. I didn’t go to Harvard or one of those Ivy League schools, but that’s not a good thing.’’League-wide attendance is down about 800,000 compared with the same point last year. The final 2018 attendance – 69.7 million – was MLB's lowest figure since 2003.It's not just the bad teams, either. The first-place New York Yankees are on pace to see about 160,000 fewer fans walk through the gates compared to last year.And you can’t blame the players; it’s the philosophies being taught all the way down to Little League these days.ROBO-UMPIRES: An inside look at baseball's futureATLANTIC LEAGUE RULES: Stealing first base and all the other MLB tests“Just go to Twitter and search 'hitting guru,’ ” Maddon told reporters last week, “and find out all these different people making money these days. They’re making it too complicated, and it’s really sad. I grew up as a hitting coach, and I taught hitting a certain way. And I still think it’s germane to the way you should hit today. ... “I’ve seen some of the videos that they’re selling online, that parents are paying for. Wow. They’re just promoting the strikeout. That’s all they’re doing.’’For the 12th consecutive season, hitters are on pace to break the strikeout record with 42,607 – 1,400 more than last year.This year, 36% of all plate appearances have resulted in a strikeout, homer, walk or hit-by-pitch.“We’re seeing all kind of guys who can hit home runs,’’ Rose said, “but they can’t hit.’’Of course, that dovetails with the record home run rate this season. Entering Sunday, the league was on pace for 6,823 homers, more than 700 above the record set in 2017.“Most of the guys that go up to the plate just try to hit home runs.’’’ said Phillies hitting coach Charlie Manuel, 75, hired last week. The old school coach led the Phillies to a World Series as the manager in 2008 and was brought back in a desperate effort to shake things up and save the team's season.In the past two weeks, three rookies – Mike Yastrzemski of the Giants, Aristides Aquino of the Reds and Yordan Alvarez of the Astros – have hit three home runs in a game. Never before had more than two rookies accomplished the feat in the same season.Aquino set a big-league record with 11 home runs in his first 17 games.Are we even supposed to get excited anymore?And as the new generation of executives, scouts and coaches gains a foothold around the league, baseball experience – or lack thereof – has become a concern to those who have spent nearly their whole lives in the game.“Where does experience factor in to teach these kids?” one high-ranking executive told USA TODAY Sports. “Why are we phasing those guys out? We’re not hiring guys with experience anymore, but guys who can read spreadsheets.’’The executive spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of his comments.Said Gossage: “They got it so an [expletive] coming off the street who doesn’t even know what a damn baseball is can manage our sport. It’s like rotisserie baseball. These [expletives] won their rotisserie leagues at Harvard and all of those [expletive] schools and now they’re general [expletive] managers.”Meanwhile, look around the other leagues. Is there a greater NBA coach today than 70-year-old Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs? Who’s better than 67-year-old Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots? Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski, 72, continues to get it done. And of course, 67-year-old football coach Nick Saban keeps rolling at Alabama.It doesn’t seem like anybody is trying to run those guys out.“This is a game that sustained itself for over 100 years,’’ Gossage said, “and you don’t think those damn executives knew what the [bleep] they were doing?“The knowledge you learned in this game was passing the torch. Well, there’s no one passing it anymore. You can’t pass it when they don’t want it.’’Follow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale",0.0

28," Article content The Edmonton Oilers are down to about three candidates in their GM search, Elliotte Friedman told Bob Stauffer on Oilers Now today. “I think you’re in your second phase right now, and I think the Oilers are down to probably three people, and I think they interviewed a lot of people, but I think they’re down to about three, and I think Hunter is one, and I think McCrimmon is one, and I’m not 100 per cent sure the other. I always leave the wild card is: What does Ken Holland want to do…I’ve been on Ken Holland at the beginning as someone who would be very much be on the Oiler radar if he was interested. I don’t have the answer to that at this point in time. But I do believe that if he’s interested he is very much a factor.” Friedman said the Oilers could well announce a hiring after the World Junior 18 tournament ends on April 28. Stauffer then said the Oilers pro and amateur scout meetings take place over the next ten days.   Article content Added Friedman added: “I think you’re in a position where probably the biggest question is going to be: what is the level of power that someone who can come in is going to get? I think that’s what people want to know the answer is.” Stauffer said with Hunter and McCrimmon, it would be GM only positions. Update: Ryan Rishaug of TSN reports that Nicholson is down to three or four candidates, with Sean Burke likely in the mix as well. “Burke is an interesting option, known to be extremely well prepared and very thorough. Dark horse candidate we don’t hear a lot about.” My take I have no useful opinion at this point on who will do the best job, Hunter, McCrimmon or someone else. That said, I am happy with the process where the Oilers have listened to and talked to multiple candidates. It can only help the entire organization to get this kind of critique and knowledge.If Hunter or McCrimmon are only the GM, it’s not reasonable for Nicholson to be President of Hockey Operations. Not only is he not qualified for that job, as seen with the Chiarelli hiring process, but it will muddy the waters for the organization. The Oilers need someone who answers directly to the owner who isn’t directly involved in hockey ops but can act as a buffer between Katz and hockey ops, and also who judge hockey ops impartially and hold it accountable, as Nicholson did this past year.With the Leafs, Hunter was there for three drafts, 2015, 2016, 2017 as asst. GM. Those drafts have a mixed record of success.I’ll rely on the work of my colleague Kurt Leavins in reporting on McCrimmon and Hunter for now. For Kurt’s list of all ten final candidates, go here and here. For what it’s worth, he did not see Burke as one of the top ten finalists, so a dark horse indeed. Burke has held management and scouting jobs with Arizona and Montreal.   Article content Here is what Leavins reported on Hunter: Pro Experience: 4 years – 1 year Director of Player Personnel (Leafs), 3 years Assistant General Manager (Leafs). Key Role – Pro and Amateur Scouting. Amateur Experience: 12 years Owner, General Manager London Knights (OHL). Top 3 Draft Picks: Austin Matthews (212), Mitch Marner (241), Travis Dermott (101). Only 4 of his picks have played in the NHL (Grundstrom, 15 GP). Biggest Hit: The Marner selection, over Noah Hanifin. Inspired. Biggest Miss: Timothy Liljegren, drafted 17th over-all in 2017. And, of course, the fact that Hunter didn’t get the “big job” in T.O. Lasting Legacy: His considerable junior record, as his stamp on pro hockey as an Executive to date has been “one and out”. Intangible: Was seen as the “eye” guy to Kyle Dubas’ analytics. Also some Eastern media bias. And on McCrimmon: Pro Experience: 2 1/2 years – Assistant General Manager (Vegas). Amateur Experience: 27 years, General Manager/Head Coach Brandon Wheat Kings (WHL). Top 3 Draft Picks: Nick Suzuki (0), Cody Glass (0), Ivan Morozov (0). Only one of McCrimmon’s picks has played in the NHL (Brannstrom, 2 GP). But to be fair it’s a pretty small sample to date. Biggest Hit: Mark Stone acquisition. Honorable mentions: Jonathan Marchessault, Marc-Andre Fleury expansion selections. But the Stone deal is thought to have been engineered largely by McCrimmon. Biggest Miss: G.M killer Griffin Reinhart. Expansion pick has yet to play a regular season NHL game for Vegas. Small word.   Article content Lasting Legacy: George McPhee’s right-hand man during the expansion draft, the most successful in NHL history. Intangibles: Thought to be #1 on Seattle’s hit list.

29,"Virginia 83, Texas Tech 75, FINALVirginia has won its first national championship. After Texas Tech went up by three in overtime, the Cavaliers went on an 11-0 run to take charge. Eight of those points came from the free-throw line. From there, the Cavaliers did the rest to run out the clock.Much of the credit goes to De'Andre Hunter, who had a career-high 27 points and the three-point shot that sent the game to overtime.In a game that was expected to be defensive-oriented, both teams should get credit for making clutch shot after clutch shot. It was highly entertaining and among the better championship games in recent history.Virginia 75, Texas Tech 73, 1:06 left in overtimeMatt Mooney had five quick points to help give Texas Tech a thee-point lead. But then Virginia came back. Kyle Guy hit a pair of free throw. And then another clutch three from De'Andre Hunter in the corner put Virginiai up two. Hunter has a career-high 29 points.Virginia 68, Texas Tech 68, end of regulationJarrett Culver's driving layup with his left hand put Texas Tech in front with 35 seconds left. And with a Ty Jerome missed layup, Norene Odiase got the rebound and hit two free throws to put the Red Raiders up three with 22 seconds left.It was all looking good for Tech until De'Andre Hunter's corner jumper tied things up with 12 seconds left. Culver tried a three to win the game and missed. After the ball went out of bound, the Red Raiders had another final chance that was blocked. Five more minutes of basketball.Virginia 65, Texas Tech 64, 1:31 left in the second half It's shot-making back and forth in the final minutes. De'Andre Hunter from the elbow and Kyle Guy with a driving layup for Virginia. Davide Moretti hits a three to pull Texas Tech within one. Timeout Texas Tech. Virginia 59, Texas Tech 58, 3:28 left in the second half And just like that Texas Tech is right back in it. Matt Mooney hit a three coming out of the timeout and then Norense Odiase was fouled on layup. He'll go to the line after the break with a chance to tie things up. This game is following the pattern of the national semifinal where Virginia had a 10-point lead late and Auburn surged at the end. Could we be set for another wild finish? Virginia 59, Texas Tech 53, 4:47 left in the second half The big three of Kyle Guy, Ty Jerome and De'Andre Hunter has just been too good for Texas Tech. The Virginia trio has 49 of the team's 59 points with Guy leading the way with 18. Meanwhile, Red Raiders guard Matt Mooney has been held to just two points and has struggled to find open looks. Still, Texas Tech has hung around to have a chance if it can make a late run.Virginia 55, Texas Tech 47: 7:23 left in second halfThe Cavaliers simply have been shooting too well for the Texas Tech defense. Led by Kyle Guy, who is 4-for-6 from behind the arc, Virginia is 9-for-19 from the three-point line. Guy is now up to a game-high 18 points. A couple of drives for Davide Moretti kept the Red Raiders in range. But they'll need some stops and some shots to go down to get closer.Virginia 50, Texas Tech 41: 11:24 left in second halfThe starters for Texas Tech have been struggling so its been substitutes Brandone Francis and Kyler Edwards that have produced the majority of their points. Francis has 13 and Edwards has 8. But the Cavaliers keep their lead on consecutive threes by De'Andre Hunter. Virginia 42, Texas Tech 35: 14:15 left in second halfThe Cavaliers are starting to ease away. They started with five quick points in the second half, the first three on a jumper by Kyle Guy who leads all scorers with 15 points. Jarrett Culver finally hit his first field goal. And then hit another on a similar drive, The Red Raiders top scorer is 2-for-10 from the field. Virginia 32, Texas Tech 29: HALFTIMEIt was a highly competitive first 20 minutes with both teams having their moments and also having long stretches without offense. Ty Jerome hits a three with under two seconds left to give Virginia its lead as part of an 11-4 run after Texas Tech had gone up four.Cavaliers guard Kyle Guy leads all scorers with 10. Davide Moretti and substitute Brandone Francis top the Red Raiders with eight points. Jarrett Culver and De'Andre Hunter have struggled. Culver is 0-for-6 from the field. Hunter is 1-for-9. Texas Tech 25, Virginia 24: 3:57 left in the first half.The Red Raiders retook the lead on a pair of free throws by Kyler Edwards. A Matt Mooney jumper increased the advantage to four. A Kihei Clark stopped the spurt and ended a stretch where Virginia had just one field goal in six minutes. Early expectations of this being dull and boring have been overstated. That said, there's not a lot of room to maneuver and fast break points are rare.Virginia 19, Texas Tech 16: 7:54 left in the first halfPerhaps it was early jitters or just a lot of nervous energy, but the offense has started to pick up. Brandone Francis has hit consecutive threes as part of a 9-2 run by Texas Tech. Francis, a sub, leads all scorers with six. Virginia had led by 10 before the spurt by the Red Raiders.Virginia 12, Texas Tech 6: 11:24 left in the first halfIt took 7:22 before Texas Tech had its first field goal - a three from Davide Moretti. But Kyle Guy's stepback three pushed the Virginia lead back to six. Cavaliers will also have De'Andre Hunter going to the line after the second media timeout.Virginia 9, Texas Tech 3: 12:56 left in the first halfVirginia has hit some shots. Texas Tech has still not with its early 0-8 shooting. The Cavaliers are on a 7-0, capped by Braxton Key dunk. The field goal came after Ty Jerome connected on the game's first three. The Red Raiders look discombobulated on offense. They're rushing shots and making passes into the teeth of the Virginia defense. Chris Beard calls timeout to try and settle things down.Texas Tech 3, Virginia 2: 15:51 left in the first halfJust as we expected, the defenses are having their way. Texas Tech twice has had to rush shots late in the shot clock. The Red Raiders don't have a field goal, but lead after three free throws by Jarrett Culver on shooting fouls. Virginia's Mamade Diakite has the lone field goal of game as the teams are a combined 1-for-9 shooting from the field.--After 66 games of the NCAA tournament, there are two teams left standing.Virginia - the No. 1 seed from the South Regional - and Texas Tech - the No. 3 seed from the West Regional - face off for the NCAA men's college basketball national championship on Monday in Minneapolis. Both schools are seeking their first title.Defense is expected to dominate as both teams do an outstanding job harassing offenses. Red Raiders guard Jarrett Culver had an off game against Michigan State in the semifinal, before couple of key late baskets. He will be looked to carry the scoring load with guard Matt Mooney.For Virginia, it likely will be Kyle Guy, De'Andre Hunter and Ty Jerome leading the way. Guy, like Culver, did not have his best game Saturday, but his clutch three and then three late free throws lifted the Cavaliers past Auburn.GAME PREVIEWEXPERT PICKS:Our staff makes the call between Texas Tech and VirginiaBREAKDOWN:Who has the edge at each position in the national title game?LIVING ON EDGE:Virginia had close calls, but is one step from championshipEXPECT DEFENSE:Texas Tech-Virginia game won't be best of college basketballWHY NOT?:Chris Beard bullish on Texas Tech's title chances after Final Four win",0.0

34,"Some of the most memorable games from the 11-season coaching tenure of Ara Parseghian at Notre Dame:Southern California 20, No. 1 Notre Dame 17, Nov. 28, 1964After finishing 2-7 a season earlier, the Irish started the season 9-0 under first-year coach Parseghian. They led the Trojans 17-0 at halftime and appeared to be on the verge of their first national title since 1949. USC rallied in the second half and won after Craig Fertig completed a 15-yard touchdown pass to Rod Sherman on a fourth-and-8 with 1:33 left to play. Notre Dame finishes ranked No. 3.___No. 1 Notre Dame 10, Michigan State 10, Nov. 19, 1966The Irish rallied from a 10-0 deficit against a Spartans team that featured Bubba Smith and three teammates who were among the top eight picks of the next NFL draft. Parseghian was criticized for his conservative play-calling after Notre Dame got the ball back with more than a minute left to play. Notre Dame won the national championship after beating USC 51-0 a week later.___No. 1 Texas 21, No. 9 Notre Dame 17, Jan. 1, 1970Playing in its first bowl game in 45 years, the Irish lost to the unbeaten Longhorns when Bill Dale scored on a 1-yard run with 1:08 left to play in the Cotton Bowl.

36,"A 70-year-old runner who was recently disqualified from the Los Angeles Marathon for alleged cheating was found dead in the Los Angeles River on Thursday, according to authorities. The Los Angeles County Coroner's office confirmed to USA TODAY Sports the death of Frank Meza, a retired physician who drew widespread attention for the marathon cheating scandal. He was pronounced dead at the scene — under the LA Riverbed underneath Figueroa Street —  at 10:05 a.m. Thursday. The autopsy is still pending. Los Angeles Police Department public information officer Greg Kraft told USA TODAY Sports a body was found Thursday at 9:49 a.m. in the LA River near Cypress Park neighborhood, but did not suspect the death came as a result of drowning. The investigation into the death remains ongoing.“Running was very important to my husband,” Meza's wife, Tina, told The Daily Beastearly Friday. “He had been running marathons for the last 30 or 40 years. He was very fast, quite fast, and now unfortunately he won’t run marathons any more.”Meza, who denied cheating, was disqualified July 1 by officials who run the marathon, the Conqur Endurance Group, after a video review showed he left the course for a part of his March race. Meza finished the race with the fastest time ever for a man his age — 2 hours, 53 minutes, 10 seconds. The second-place finish was 4:10:07.Tina Meza said that her husband told her Thursday morning he was going for a run. “I said, ‘It will be good for you,’ and he said, ‘I‘ll see you later,’” she said, according to The Daily Beast.Meza said he did leave the course in March but that it was to find a bathroom.“What I can tell you is that I did not cut. My last few marathons I have had to step off the course, looking for a place to pee,” Meza told the Canadian Running magazine in June. ""I didn’t know this was against the rules, I was not aware of that. I’ve done this several times. I’ve realized my problem is that I don’t hydrate properly. I have never cut the distance but I have stepped off of the course.""",0.0

40,"Nick Vogel has been around for the long-haul.One of four remaining players from the last UAB football team before the program was shut down, the junior kicker was the first to return to campus following a short stint at the rival school three-and-a-half hours down the road.The Jacksonville, Fla. native bought in from the start when head coach Bill Clark took control of the program more than four years ago and did not hesitate to return when it was announced the program would return in 2017 following a brief two-year hiatus. The loyalty paid off for Vogel as the Blazers are 9-1 overall this season, ranked No. 25 in the Coaches poll and set to visit SEC opponent Texas A&M this weekend.There was never a doubt in his mind.""It's been a heck of a ride,"" Vogel said. ""When the program closed, I went to Southern Miss. When I came back, these were the kind of things I was expecting. I knew the kind of coach that Coach Clark was. He was part of the reason that I came back. I fully believed in him to bring us to this point. It took us two years, which is way shorter than anyone would've guessed, but we're here and happy to be here.""Vogel might be more than just happy as he came into the program during the dark ages when there wasn't even enough room to find a seat during team meetings, forcing him to carve out a spot on the floor in the old dentist office turned operations complex. The dirt track and lumpy practice fields are gone but Vogel can still remember the hardships of going through the process of the program's dismissal and rebuilding it from scratch.""It's night and day,"" he said. ""While it's painful to go through, the support is really night and day. Back in 2014, there really wasn't that much support. There weren't really many people paying attention. The crowds weren't the same. Ever since we came back, it's been insane.""""The crowds are way bigger, obviously. There's been a lot more fan support. I even have people come up to me when I eat at restaurants and say hello. There's a lot of people taking notes and watching. People know who UAB is.""Aside from the adversity of leaving then returning, Vogel has excelled in the kicking game for the Blazers. He's been perfect this season on extra-point attempts (42 of 42) and is 9 of 15 on field goal attempts with a long of 51 yards against UTSA.His most impressive feat, however, might be his touchback ratio which is fourth in the nation. Out of a total 61 kickoffs this season, Vogel has kicked a touchback 54 times. Opponents have returned only four of Vogel's kicks - for a total of 90 yards - while taking advantage of the new fair catch rule three times this season.Despite his avoidance of being crushed beneath men twice the size on average, Vogel has endeared himself to UAB fans and has even garnered the nickname 'Vogeltron' for his strong kicking game.""I don't know how that came about, I do think it's kind of funny,"" he said. ""I don't pay too much attention to that kind of stuff. Isn't that like Megatron? He's not good, is he? That's a not a good thing, I guess. Or maybe it is, we'll see.""The Blazers have already wrapped up a division title but step out-of-conference this week in traveling to College Station to face off against SEC foe Texas A&M. Vogel was ready for his moment last week in the overtime victory over Southern Miss but conceded it to running back Spencer Brown in hopes of a bigger payday on a national stage.""I'm sure we'd like to win by a lot of points but I love kicking,"" Vogel said. ""Last week I thought I was going to have a game-winning field goal against Southern Miss but no big deal about that, Spencer can have that one. My dream finish would be a game-winning field goal against A&M so that'd be pretty cool.""",0.0
41,"NFL teams with new head coaches in 2019 can start their offseason programs as soon as Monday. For other teams, the offseason work can begin on April 15.As NFL teams work their way toward the opening of training camps in late July, they'll have questions to answer and issues to resolve. Some of those include personnel from Alabama high schools and colleges.Among the questions are:Stacy RevereWill Julio Jones become the NFL's highest-paid wide receiver?After the former Foley High School and Alabama standout missed last year's offseason program, the Atlanta Falcons got the wide receiver to training camp with a reworked 2018 pay structure and the promise of a new contract in 2019, even though he has two seasons left on his current five-year, $71.2 million deal. The most lucrative contract held by a wide receiver currently is the five-year, $90 million deal of the Cleveland Browns' Odell Beckham Jr. It included $40.959 million guaranteed at signing and has an average value of $18 million per year -- both also highs for wide receivers.Tom SzczerbowskiWill Levi Wallace's Cinderella story continue?A walk-on at Alabama, Wallace entered the NFL as an undrafted rookie with the Buffalo Bills. After spending most of the 2018 season on the Bills' practice squad, the cornerback joined the active roster for the 10th game and played 375 of Buffalo's 386 defensive snaps the rest of the way. Wallace was the fourth (and longest-lasting) cornerback to start opposite Tre'Davious White in the Bills' secondary in 2018. But that doesn't mean Buffalo has him penciled in as the 2019 starter, even for the opening of offseason drills. The Bills added first-round draft choice Kevin Johnson and former Buffalo starter E.J. Gaines to the cornerback depth chart via free agency, presenting Wallace with another hill to climb.Jason MillerHow will Cam Newton's throwing shoulder respond after surgery?The former Auburn standout's ailing shoulder sank the Carolina Panthers' 2018 season after a good start for the quarterback and the team. Newton had arthroscopic surgery in January, and Carolina coach Ron Rivera said at the league's annual meeting last week that ""things are trending in the right direction."" The Panthers have indicated that Newton will be ready at least by training camp.Matt YorkHow will Freddie Kitchens handle offseason preparations for his first year as an NFL head coach? The former Etowah High School and Alabama standout ascended from running-backs coach to offensive coordinator to head coach of the Cleveland Browns in a matter of months, taking the reins for a team that hasn't generated this much buzz in a long time. With No. 1 draft choice Baker Mayfield heading for his second season as an NFL quarterback and wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. coming aboard via trade, the expectations seem outsized for a franchise that has won 11 games in the previous four years. Kitchens doesn't appear fazed as his straight-shooting, down-home personality has spread smiles and drawn admiration across the league. At the NFL's annual meeting last week, Kitchens said: ""I've never seen one team make the Super Bowl without having those expectations. I don't mind expectations. I want them. I guarantee the New England Patriots, their expectation next year is to play in the Super Bowl. Now we're not in the predicting business, but we're going to take an every-day approach to do our jobs and then we will see where we are a week from now, then a month, then a year. In January, we'll see if we're good enough. We might not play good enough, or we might not have coached good enough, but that's always going to be our goal.""Gregory ShamusWill the players injured during 2018 be healthy for 2019?As with every NFL season, numerous players with Alabama football roots had their most recent campaigns ended prematurely and finished the season on injured reserve. Among the players who missed chunks of the 2018 season on IR was Cleveland Browns wide receiver Ricardo Louis (above), who had neck surgery last summer and missed the entire year. Last month, the former Auburn standout tweeted, ""I'm ready to get back on the field … coming back on a mission,"" and last week, he posted a video on Instagram that showed him working out.Among the leading players who missed chunks of 2018 were Jacksonville Jaguars offensive tackle Cam Robinson (Alabama), who missed 13 games because of a torn anterior cruciate ligament; Cincinnati Bengals defensive end Carl Lawson (Auburn), who missed nine games because of a torn ACL; Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end O.J. Howard (Autauga Academy, Alabama), who missed six games because of ankle and foot injuries; and Detroit Lions running back Kerryon Johnson (Madison Academy, Auburn), who missed six games because of a sprained knee. Those players are expected to bounce back fully in 2019.AP PhotoWill the Colts pick up Ryan Kelly's fifth-year option?As a first-round draft choice, Indianapolis Colts center Ryan Kelly's rookie contract included a team option for a fifth season. The 18th player picked in the 2016 draft, the former Alabama standout has been a starter from the start for the Colts, but he's missed 13 games in the past two seasons. Indianapolis has a May 3 deadline to exercise its option for the 2020 season. If the Colts use their option, they would pay Kelly the average salary of the offensive linemen with the third- through 25th-highest salaries in 2019, which should be close to $10 million. Kelly has a base salary of $1.875 million for 2019. The money becomes guaranteed against injury as soon as Indianapolis uses the option and fully guaranteed when the NFL's 2020 business year begins in March.Peter AikenIs All-Pro Tyreek Hill headed for disciplinary action?Earlier this year, there were reports the Kansas City Chiefs were working on a record-setting contract with wide receiver Tyreek Hill after the former West Alabama standout set a franchise single-season record for receiving yards in 2018. Then came news that the Overland Park (Kansas) Police Department and Kansas Department for Children and Families were investigating allegations of battery and child abuse or neglect at Hill's home. Perhaps compounding the unease around Hill's situation is an incident from his past. Hill pleaded guilty in August 2015 to felony domestic assault and battery of his pregnant girlfriend. He received a three-year deferred sentence with probation and was ordered to complete an anger-management course and a 52-week batterer's intervention program. Hill completed his probation in August, causing the domestic-abuse charges to be dismissed and his record to be expunged.Michael ReavesWill Minkah Fitzpatrick and Bobby McCain settle into set positions in the Miami secondary?After being selected from Alabama in the first round of the 2018 NFL Draft, Fitzpatrick (above) played slot corner, boundary corner and safety for the Dolphins as a rookie. Fitzpatrick's use in the slot and need for a No. 2 corner pushed McCain outside for much of the first half of the season after the former Oxford High School standout had spent three seasons as a nickelback. New coach Brian Flores said during the NFL's annual meeting last week that the Dolpins had ""spent a lot of time thinking about how we're going to use"" Fitzpatrick, but he declined to share what had been decided. Miami has two well-compensated, veteran safeties and added a cornerback in free agency to add more complexity to the mix, too.Hannah FoslienHow will the Eagles incorporate Jordan Howard into their offense?When the former Gardendale High School and UAB standout starts learning the Eagles' offense, he's likely to find more to his liking than in the team's he left last week in a trade. After Howard ran for 3,370 yards in his first three NFL seasons, the Chicago Bears let him go in exchange for a sixth-round selection in the 2020 NFL Draft. Howard ran for 1,313 yards in 2016 and 1,122 in 2017, but he dipped to 935 in 2018, his first season in coach Matt Nagy's offense. That offense is built for players who are good in space and ball-carriers who can take advantage of cutback lanes. Howard is a north-south runner, though, and that attribute is liable to put him back on track in Philadelphia.Ezra ShawWho will emerge as the 49ers' backup quarterback?When San Francisco lost quarterback Jimmy Garappolo to a season-ending knee injury in the third game of 2018, backup C.J. Beathard took over under center and the 49ers moved former Spain Park High School standout Nick Mullens (above) from the practice squad. San Francisco went 0-5 in Beathard's starts, and when a wrist injury kept him from answering the bell for the season's ninth game, Mullens got to play -- and took every snap for the rest of the season. The 49ers won three of Mullens' eight starts as he threw for 2,277 yards. Only three players in NFL history have had more passing yards in their first eight games than Mullens -- Cam Newton, Andrew Luck and Patrick Mahomes. But at the NFL's annual meeting last week, 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said the backup-QB job is up for grabs between Mullens and Beathard as Garappolo returns in 2019.Jamie SquireHow will Dee Ford adapt to the 49ers' defensive line?After four seasons as an outside linebacker with the Kansas City Chiefs, Ford will be designated a defensive end again -- as he was at Auburn -- after being franchise-tagged, traded and signed to a five-year, $85.5 million contract this offseason. The 49ers targeted Ford for their LEO role, which might suit Ford even better than being a 3-4 outside linebacker. The former St. Clair County High School standout's duty in San Francisco will be almost exclusively to get into the opponent's backfield.Will VragovicHow will Bruce Arians affect Jameis Winston?The Tampa Bay Buccaneers' choice of the former Arizona Cardinals coach and Alabama assistant to lead the team in 2019 appeared to be hailed from all quarters of the league, with particular acclamations that Arians would guide Winston toward the top tier of NFL quarterbacks. Since the former Hueytown High School standout entered the NFL as the No. 1 pick in the 2015 draft, he's thrown for 14,628 yards -- a total that's been exceeded by only nine players in their first four seasons in NFL history. But in his four seasons, only one quarterback has thrown more interceptions and only three players have fumbled more than Winston has, and the Bucs have a 21-33 record in his starts. He also started the 2018 season serving a three-game NFL suspension. As Winston heads toward the final season of his contract, Arians has said, ""There's no reason he can't be really, really successful.""Ezra ShawWhat will the NFL decide concerning Reuben Foster?The former Auburn High School and Alabama linebacker started the 2018 season serving a two-game NFL suspension. Will he do something similar in 2019? Foster is on the Washington Redskins' roster, but he's also in limbo because of his placement by the NFL on the Commissioner Exempt List. The league is investigating Foster's arrest on Nov. 24, when he was charged with one misdemeanor count of first-degree domestic battery. That charge was later dismissed, but an NFL spokesman said recently the league has no timetable for completing its investigation.Christian PetersenHow many former Alabama players will earn starting spots with the Redskins' defense?Washington signed safety Landon Collins to a six-year, $84 million in free agency this offseason, which will put at least three Alabama alumni on the field with the Redskins' No. 1 defense -- Collins and defensive linemen Jonathan Allen (above) and Da'Ron Payne, the team's first-round draft choices in 2017 and 2018, respectively. It could be more. With Preston Smith leaving for the Green Bay Packers in free agency, Ryan Anderson ascends to the top of the depth chart in Smith's outside-linebacker spot entering the offseason program. Shaun Dion Hamilton started the final four games of his rookie season at inside linebacker, and the release of Zach Brown earlier this month keeps Hamilton as the top option at this time. Washington should have Reuben Foster available at inside linebacker, too, eventually, once the NFL decides what to do about his current status on the Commissioner Except List.Christian PetersenWill the unsigned free agents find teams for 2019?Thirteen players from Alabama high schools and colleges who played in the NFL during the 2018 season are unsigned free agents. Several of the players are well-established NFL players. Among those looking for teams for 2019 are linebacker Josh Bynes (above, Auburn), running back Corey Grant (Opelika, Auburn), defensive end Michael Johnson (Dallas County), offensive tackle Cyrus Kouandjio (Alabama), cornerback Captain Munnerlyn (Murphy), place-kicker Cody Parkey (Auburn), offensive tackle Andre Smith (Huffman, Alabama), defensive lineman Damion Square (Alabama), safety Darian Stewart (Lee-Huntsville), long snapper Carson Tinker (Alabama), safety Brynden Trawick (Troy), guard Chance Warmack (Alabama) and running back T.J.

44,"Correction and clarification: A previous version of this story included a graphic with an incorrect percentage change. The Blue Jays dropped by 25%. Major League Baseball’s attendance problem is not going away, as a significant dip in 2018 has endured into the new season – even with better weather and a boost from some big-name stars on the move.As the game’s worst part of the calendar comes to a close, 12 of 30 teams will draw fewer fans in March-April than they did in a similar period last year – with seven of those teams seeing double-digit percentage dips, led by the Toronto Blue Jays’ 33% drop-off, according to research by USA TODAY Sports.Perhaps more alarmingly, 15 teams saw a decrease in their worst March-April gate, which can serve as a relatively informed snapshot of a club’s season-ticket base. Twelve teams’ worst gate was 11,000 or less, with four teams – Pittsburgh (8,523), Cincinnati (7,799), Baltimore (6,585) and Miami (5,934) sporting a base of less than 10,000.Overall, the average major league team's average March-April crowd is virtually flat – 26,560, compared to 26,859, a drop of less than 1%. However, that new baseline comes after the 2018 season saw a 4% drop in attendance across the major leagues, the largest in a decade. Commissioner Rob Manfred has maintained that poor weather in the early part of the season was a significant reason for the slide.That’s far less of a factor this season, and perhaps a signal that those attendance losses will endure.There were 28 postponements in March-April 2018, as miserable weather wreaked havoc on virtually every region outside the Sun Belt. This season, 13 games have been postponed as generally more traditional spring weather has prevailed. In Chicago, where the Cubs saw three of their first eight 2018 home games postponed due to snow, rain and cold weather, the average April temperature this year was 51 degrees – up from 42 in April 2018.POWER RANKINGS: Dodgers silencing the hatersMACHADO, HARPER: How they have impacted their teamsThe largest and most enduring drops seem to come from clubs pivoting to a rebuilding mode – or unable to dig their way out of one.The most startling loss comes in San Francisco. The Giants have been almost perennial contenders and drew at least 3 million fans in 18 of 20 seasons at Oracle (neé Pacific Bell and AT&T) Park. Bound for their third straight losing season and with a concerted rebuilding effort at hand, the Giants are averaging 32,665 fans – down 17% from an average of 39,278 in March-April 2018.The Giants could not exceed their average for a Saturday afternoon game against the New York Yankees, which was paired with a Willie Mays bobblehead giveaway. Monday’s opener of a series against the Los Angeles Dodgers – traditionally a big draw – also did not push attendance past 32,000.The Reds (down 11%, to 15,435) and Rays (down 8%, to 14,008) have suffered losses despite offseasons that were more robust than usual on the trade or free agent fronts; the Rays are even off to a major league-best 19-9 start. Six of the Rays’ 16 home dates have drawn crowds of less than 10,000, two more than 2018, when they drew four such crowds after a 3-12 start.The Cubs and Colorado Rockies both have percentage changes of less than 1%; of the 16 clubs with attendance bumps, 15 are gains of 8% or less – with one notable exception.The Philadelphia Phillies, whose signing of Bryce Harper to a $330 million contract was the centerpiece of a wild off-season, are averaging 37,280 fans – a whopping 44% gain over the average of 25,811 to this point last year.Perhaps more encouraging, they’ve seen a 55% jump in their worst crowd – from 28,000 to 34,000 – which would indicate a very robust season-ticket base.Philly's crowds should further swell as spring gives way to summer, particularly if the ballclub remains atop the NL East. Every team, of course, will draw better once school is out and competition from other sports dissipates. But if you're only as strong as your weakest link, the early returns are not encouraging for baseball.  ",0.0

46,"Michael Robinson%27s career nearly ended in August after kidney and liver failureRobinson said the illness was the result of a bad reaction to a prescription anti-inflammatory medicineRobinson re-signed with the Seahawks Oct. 22 and has become sort of an elder statesman in Seattle lockerJERSEY CITY — Seattle Seahawks fullback Michael Robinson knew he was in trouble the third time he went to the hospital and doctors pumped him full of morphine to ease the pain.It was August, and Robinson was fighting for a job he ended up losing, along with more than 30 pounds before the Seahawks released him in the final roster reduction.The issue, Robinson said, was a bad reaction to the prescription anti-inflammatory medicine Indocin — and there was a point at which he believed it had ended his NFL career.""I was dehydrated and probably getting a bug or a little sick anyways,"" Robinson recalled Monday at The Westin Jersey City Newport, home to the Seahawks during their preparations for Super Bowl XLVIII against the Broncos.""After the second preseason game against Denver, I just felt like I was getting the flu. I had mentioned to the doctors, 'Look man, I think I'm going to come in next week and get some fluids.' ... It just went all downhill from there — kidney failure, liver failure, all of it.""Specialists figured out the problem, but it was too late for Robinson, 30, to save his spot on the roster. By the time he recovered, interest from the New York Giants and Tennessee Titans had dried up, and Robinson set a deadline of Week 10 or 11 to get a job or call it quits.Then the two fullbacks the Seahawks kept instead of him got banged up, and Robinson re-signed Oct. 22 on a prorated minimum deal worth $494,118 — a fraction of the $2.5 million base salary he'd been due under his old contract, but plenty to entice him with a shot at a title.""I've got my weight back, got my strength back,"" Robinson said, ""and it was an opportunity to come back here, and I'm glad it opened up.""The entire ordeal surely played a role in the tears that streamed down Robinson's face after the Seahawks clinched the NFC title by beating the San Francisco 49ers, who gave Robinson his first NFL shot as a fourth-round draft pick and converted him from quarterback in 2006.He's a bit player on the field now for the Seahawks, having played just 27 snaps on offense and 27 more on special teams. But he's also the first player many teammates mention when talking about the pulse of the locker room.""He is a big factor on our team because we don't have that many older guys and he really stands for the old guard,"" Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said. ""He's been a big actor on special teams as well. You can see the emotion come out of Michael.""Robinson has side businesses already and is preparing for a post-career media career. He says he advises young teammates to approach the end of every season as if it's their last season.But he has at least one more game ahead of him, and there's little question it ranks as the most important of his eight-year career.""I've gotten a lot of questions about me crying and all that type of stuff, but it was just I had a long year being cut, being sick, not really realizing the extent of the sickness,"" Robinson said.""I didn't know that my kidneys were failing and my liver was failing. I had no idea. I just thought I was getting a bug. But again, hindsight is 20/20 and I'm glad I'm here now.""Follow national NFL reporter Tom Pelissero on Twitter @TomPelissero.",0.0

      Waiters has now missed the first nine games of Miami’s season, after having been suspended last month for “conduct detrimental to the team.” Waiters reportedly got into an argument with Heat coach Erik Spoelstra after Miami’s preseason game against the Houston Rockets.“There were a number of unacceptable incidents this week, culminating with his unprofessional conduct on the bench last night,” Heat President Pat Riley told the Sun Sentinel of South Florida on Oct. 19. “As a consequence, I feel we had to suspend him.”Of the games he has missed, Waiters was considered on the active roster for two of them – a win last Sunday against the Houston Rockets and the Thursday victory in Phoenix – but did not see playing time, according to the Herald.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPWaiters is in the third year of a four-year $52 million contract and would receive a $1.1 million bonus if he appears in 70 of the team’s 82 games this season, according to the report.Four other Heat players sat out Friday’s game against the Lakers with various injuries, the report said.

49,"BOSTON – The pregame question focused on Devin Booker.Is he the best shooter you’ve been around?“I’ve played with some great shooters,’’ Suns coach Earl Watson said, naming off a couple. “Ray Allen, Kevin Durant. He has amazing potential. His stroke is textbook.”An hour later, Booker went out and showed as much. The second-year guard produced the highest-scoring game in franchise history, pouring in 70 points in a 130-120 loss to the Boston Celtics at TD Garden. While the Suns lost for the seventh time, Booker put together the highest-scoring game of the season, passing the 60 Klay Thompson put up against Indiana in October.In the process, he became the third-youngest player in NBA history at 20 years, 145 days, to record a 50-point game, joining LeBron James and Brandon Jennings.Throughout this stretch, most of the focus has been on Phoenix’s young players, which makes sense. Both rookie point guard Tyler Ulis and forward Alan Williams have made good use of their extended minutes – something that will serve management well in their short-term decision-making – but this also is an important time for Booker, a gifted scorer who already has one foot in the stardom pool.By now, most know that in two years Booker has scored in ways not many have. Before turning 20 in October, he scored 1,087 points as a teenager, sixth most in NBA history. Of the five players ahead of him on that list – James, Kobe Bryant, Carmelo Anthony, Kevin Durant and Dwight Howard – all but Anthony were All-Stars within their third seasons. Anthony made it in his fourth season.MORE NBA:10 years ago, Kobe Bryant joined one of NBA's most exclusive clubsJames Harden comes up clutch as Rockets defeat PelicansNBA playoff chase: Six teams battling for seeding in the EastBooker began this trip in a slump. While battling ankle soreness, he was 13 of 55 over three games entering Thursday’s Brooklyn loss. Booker said he wasn’t concerned. “I’m just missing a lot of shots right now,” he said then. “Same shots I’ve seen go in before.”He showed signs of breaking out against Brooklyn, but cooled in the second half, shooting 9 of 26 but finishing with 28 points. Against the Celtics, Booker looked more like himself. Once he got rolling, he didn't stop.  He hit a bank shot in transition. He hit a jumper and was fouled. He scored in the post.He even got some whistles.This was an issue against Brooklyn, particularly in the second half. Booker doesn’t shy from contact, but against the Nets he didn’t get many calls. That night he led both teams in looks of disbelief. In Friday’s second quarter, Booker drove left, fell to the court and didn’t get a call. As Boston took off in transition, he shot a stare at the nearest official.On Phoenix’s next possession, Booker took the ball in the post and lowered his shoulder into Boston guard Marcus Smart, the easiest offensive foul call of the night. Booker immediately turned and ran up court. It was if he wanted to make a point. And he may have. From that point on, Booker shot 21 free throws in the second half.Booker broke his career high of 39 points in the final minutes of the third quarter. He hit 45 with nine minutes to go in the fourth. With 6:40 left, he scored in transition and was fouled giving him the sixth 50th-point game in franchise history. By this time the Garden crowd was into it, cheering for Booker to shoot every time he got the ball.With 1:49 to go, Booker put back his own miss, breaking Tom Chambers' record of 60 points scored against Seattle in 1990. Overall, Booker shot 21 of 40 from the field and made 24 of 26 from the foul line, both makes and attempts a career best. He also contributed eight rebounds and six assists.Only problem: He didn’t have much help. The Suns again were short-handed, playing without forward T.J. Warren because of a foot injury. They missed their first 13 shots, falling behind by 20 in the first quarter. From there, it was an uphill battle. The Suns trailed by as many as 26, but pulled within 10 in the fourth quarter. It wasn't enough.And on this night, it didn't matter.Doug Haller writes for The Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network. Follow him on Twitter @DougHaller.",0.0
50,"The raw and honest emotion inside Utah Jazz general manager Dennis Lindsey came out Thursday morning after a sleepless night as he dealt with the fallout from the incident involving a Jazz fan and Oklahoma City Thunder star Russell Westbrook.Lindsey said he apologized to Thunder general manager Sam Presti and the organization. He said Jazz players and ownership ""are going to do something that's heartfelt"" following the fan's permanent ban from Utah's Vivint Smart Home Arena.""Our players are smart and socially conscious and want to use this as a forum,"" Lindsey told USA TODAY. ""Thabo (Sefolosha) talked about his time in Italy, and everybody black and white has a story, but our country, like Pop (San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich) said, we have to talk about our national sin.""People may say, 'Hey, whatever, what the fan said was a small thing.' Well, it's not. What it does is make everyone feel small, and every Caucasian should take a look at themselves and look at their heart.""The incident occurred during Monday night's game between the Thunder and Jazz. Westbrook was captured on video delivering a profane tirade at the fan — later identified as Shane Keisel — and his wife, and afterwards told reporters that Keisel had said, ""Get down on your knees like you used to.""OPINION:  No excusing fan behavior that prompted Russell Westbrook tiradeCLICK & ROLL:Sign up for our weekly NBA newsletter to get exclusive contentSpeaking to USA TODAY over the phone, Lindsey had a profound personal story he wanted to share about the intersection of his life and the incident.Lindsey at one point or another has told the stories separately: how he grew up the son of parents who supervised group homes for disadvantaged youth and how he lived in those homes; his lifelong friendship with Atlanta Hawks assistant coach Melvin Hunt, an African-American; and the death of his mother due to a drunk driver when he was in college at Baylor.But sharing those stories at once – ones crucial to who Lindsey is as a person – forced him to take emotional pauses.""Some of this I've spoke to and some of this will be the first time I’ve spoke about in public,"" Lindsey said. ""I grew up a little bit different.""Three times, he lived with those disadvantaged kids in the home – once as an infant, once from second to fourth grade and once from the middle of his sophomore year of high school through his senior year.""White, black, Hispanic, Asian, you name the race, I literally was in a house with 10-12 disadvantaged kids,"" Lindsey said. ""The thing I would say to this matter when you live with someone in closer quarters, you realize there's one race — the human race. That's what we need to be talking about. That's our national discussion and we just need to admit where it's at and where our hearts are. A lot of it is fear and ignorance.""By high school, Lindsey emerged as a talented basketball player, as did Hunt.""We were recruited together, and guess what? We are on the same recruiting visit, and guess what? We liked each other, and guess what? We roomed together,"" Lindsey said.During Lindsey's sophomore year, his parents came to visit him and watch a game. They had dinner at IHOP, and as his parents were on their way home, a drunk driver crossed the center line, hitting the Lindseys' car and killing his mom.""This is the part that's poignant to the conversation. Excuse me, give me one second,"" Lindsey said.Twenty seconds later, he continued: ""So my aunt gets Melvin’s number and asks him to be the person who tells me,"" he said.Fifteen seconds later: ""So, everybody needs to know …""Ten seconds later: ""It wasn't a black man from Tallulah, Louisiana, telling a Caucasian man from Clute, Texas, that his mom had just passed. It was just two people hugging, embracing, crying, and I've thanked him a thousand times privately.""On how Hunt's friendship and his mom's death always will be intertwined, Lindsey said, ""The coupling of the two is the most important thing that sits with me today. I can usually speak about the incident and not get emotional and speak to diversity and not get emotional, but this one is so raw and it hits home.""Literally, I somehow have to get the courage to speak to both because everybody will understand. It's not male or female or people of different colors. When times get thick, you pull together. While it was a tragic situation, it brought out the best in two different people from two difference places.""It’s a story that's long overdue given our climate. Let's just talk about our national sin and how we made a race of people feel a certain way and just listen for a second.""Emotional, thoughtful, angry and inspired, Lindsey doesn't want to waste the moment.Lindsey’s final text of his sleepless night was sent to Jazz coach Quin Snyder at 4:53 a.m. ET. Lindsey didn’t fall asleep until 6. He was up a few hours later, communicating with Jazz president Steve Starks and vice president of player personnel Walt Perrin. He had ACC Tournament games to scout later in the day.""I'm very confident in our community,"" Lindsey said. ""Our community has a good heart. I’m very confident in our organization. And we hope to lead from the front moving forward.""It's a talent to divide people. It’s a special person or special organization that can unite people and say, 'We're not standing for this hurtful speech.' It's offensive to me personally. Our people are hurting, in particular our players.""I'll take the blowback from the nonsense that’s out there. Let it come my way. I'm actually looking forward to that.""Follow Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt ",0.0
51,"The end is here for Dwyane Wade.One last bus ride from the hotel to the arena. One last pregame warm-up. One last game. One last shot. One last point. One last bus ride from the arena to the airport. One last flight back to Miami. One last drive from the airport to his home as an NBA player.Wade plays his final NBA game, in Brooklyn, on Wednesday – #onelastdance, as he dubbed it when he announced in September that the 2018-19 season would be his last.So this is it – after Wednesday’s season-ending game, it will be 1,054 regular-season games, 177 playoff games, three NBA championships, one Finals MVP award, 13 All-Star selections, eight all-NBA honors, more than 23,000 points (30th in NBA history), 3,954 playoff points (10th in history), top 30 in career steals, the most blocks by a guard in NBA history, and two Olympic medals (one gold, one bronze). The history of the NBA’s all-time greatest shooting guards, as it is written today, includes Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Jerry West, Clyde Drexler and Wade, who is a future first-ballot Hall of Famer.And for Wade, the end comes without regret or second guesses or disappointment or agony.The farewell has been wonderful, from fan acknowledgement to memorable jersey swaps to still-has-it performances to the emotional, life-affirming Budwesier short video highlighting Wade’s impact on people off the court, including his mom Jolinda.Wade reflected on his retirement during an interview with USA TODAY Sports in Minneapolis over the weekend. The interview has been edited for brevity.Q: It’s obvious you have at least another year in you. You’ve had a 35-point game this season. You just had 21 points in the first half Friday against Minnesota. How many people have suggested you should play next season?A: Everybody. Even family. A lot of people have asked me, ‘Are you having second thoughts?’ I always say, ‘I can keep playing.’ I tell everybody, ‘I’m not retiring because I can’t play no more.’ They say, ‘You’ve got another year.’ And I say, ‘Yeah, I can come back in this role, 25 minutes and come off the bench.’ I went through a lot physically, and I worked hard to get myself back to where I’m able to perform this way. I’m thankful I’m able to go out with no pain. I feel like, you know what? I’ve done enough. I’m 37 years old, 16 years, five finals. I’ve done enough. It’s time for me to move out of the way and let the next generation do their thing.GALLERY: Dwyane Wade through the yearsQ: How did you know it was time?A: It was just a feeling. It just felt like it was time. Once I got to the point where there were a lot of things in the process that I just didn’t enjoy. I don’t enjoy working out in the summers getting ready for this, the last summer. I didn’t enjoy a lot of things. Once I get to the point where I’m not enjoying the process – because I’ve enjoyed the process in my career, whether it’s coming back from injuries, coming back from losing in the Finals – and this summer I just didn’t enjoy it. It was a big sign. I think it’s time before something happens.Q: Why was it important to go out on your terms?A: There’s going to come a time no matter if it’s this year or two years from now when I’m 39, there’s going to come a time when I have to give it up. So I decided before it gets to the point where the team is looking at me and going, ‘We have to play these young guys,’ I decided I wanted to go out on my terms and still show people I can go out and I can still go a little bit. Not everyone gets to choose. I sat down and thought about that. I thought about the greats who didn’t get this opportunity. I thought about teammates who didn’t get this opportunity. You know what, like Melo told me, 'You have to do it for us to celebrate you.’ A lot of people don’t get this chance. You’ve got to take it.Q: You said you didn’t enjoy the process. What about it don’t you enjoy anymore?A: I don’t like being gone from home too long. I don’t like the fact that I have to leave my daughter to come on this road trip. I don’t like two-week road trips. I don’t like shoot- arounds in the morning. I don’t like getting up at 9 some mornings to go to shoot-around. I don’t like certain things. I understand the reason for them and all. This process is not exciting to me anymore where it used to be. I get bored with it. I try to talk myself into it …Q: What has been more gratifying about this season?A: Coming into this year, first of all, I had to muster up everything and figure out what I wanted to do. And to come back and have the ovations everywhere I’ve been and to be able to play well as well along this process has been great.You don’t know coming into the year. You don’t know how the fans are going to be. You don’t know how this season is going to be for you. I didn’t know how it was going to be. I trusted coach (Erik Spoelstra). He said to me, ‘Trust me through this process in your last season.’ You wouldn’t want anyone else helping you through this journey and I trust him.Q: How will you remember this season?A: I’m taking all the memories in. For me in my mind, I dedicated this season to my agent (Henry Thomas), who was not able to go on this journey with me. Along with this process, I just tried to make him proud and make everybody proud that we’ve handled it great off the court, that I’ve handled it well with the fans and I handled the game well and going out and being prepared and being ready and going out there and competing. I think I’ve checked the box on all those things.Q: What will you miss?A: Everything. This is what I know. I’ve been playing high-level basketball since college, almost 20 years. I’m going to miss everything, and even the things I don’t like right now, I’m going to miss.There’s nothing like getting that feeling when I run through the tunnel and I’m one of the best to play in this game. It’s a feeling you get. It’s an amazing feeling. Incredible. And just to see young kids, the way they look at you, too, just because of the sport you play. And the way parents look at you because of the way you handle yourself. There’s nothing like that look when you see a kid admiring you who has your jersey on and looking at you with these big eyes.Q: How will you spend your time?A: I have no idea. I know I have a lot of kids. I have a beautiful wife (Gabrielle Union) who has a career. I know I’ve got a lot of business things I’m doing. From there, I’ll figure everything else out. It’s going to be different. It’s going to be tough. Follow USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt ",0.0

54,"It’s been more than 25 years since Mike Riley coached a game in Legion Field.It’s been even longer since he was clad in crimson as a member of the Alabama football team in the 1970s under legendary coach Paul “Bear” Bryant.Riley returns to the Old Gray Lady this week as the head coach of the the San Antonio Commanders of the Alliance of American Football, leading his team againast the undefeated Birmingham Iron (3-0). First snap is set for Sunday at 3 p.m., at Birmingham’s Legion Field.The former Oregon State and Nebraska head coach was a reserve defensive back for the Crimson Tide from 1971-1974 – playing 15 games at Legion Field during a run that included four SEC titles and the 1973 national championship – and returned twice as a head coach in 1991 and 1992 with the San Antonio Riders of the World League of American Football.Riley coached the Riders for two seasons before the WLAF was suspended following the 1992 season and reformed as NFL Europe in 1995. Both trips to Birmingham ended in losses for the Riders, but Riley was still appreciative of the chance to coach in his old stomping grounds and bring a new team back after an extended period of time.“I love it, and I’m very very thankful for it,” Riley said. “I’m thankful for my time at Alabama. I was really excited to take the San Antonio Riders back there to play in Legion Field and I’m very excited once again to do that with the Commanders. It’s just a great part of my life and I’m very thankful for it.”
Pleasant memories aside, Riley knows he will have his hands full with an Iron team that has opened the season on a three-game winning streak. Birmingham is one of two remaining undefeated teams in the AAF and has won their first three games by an average margin of 15 points.“They’re playing very sound, on both sides of the ball,” Riley said. “They have a real identity of what they’re doing offensively and they play to their strength. They run the football well, they have a good play-action game, and they take care of the ball and they’re not afraid to punt it because they play good defense. Their recipe for winning is very very evident and they’ve done a great job of it.”The “recipe” on offense includes the league-leader in touchdowns in former Alabama running back Trent Richardson, and former Texas A&M-Commerce quarterback Luis Perez, who has completed 58.8 percent of his throws for 596 yards with only one interception. Quinton Patton has emerged as the go-to target for Perez, hauling in 11 passes for 209 yards, while L’Damien Washington brought down some clutch catches in the Iron’s 28-12 victory over Atlanta.Defensively, the Iron lead the AAF by allowing only seven points per game while forcing eight turnovers. Riley alluded to Birmingham’s ability to punt without fear relative to its defense but punter Colton Schmidt has made it much easier with a 43-yard average per kick and was named the league’s Special Teams player of the Week after his performance against Atlanta.Riley and the Commanders face off against the undefeated Iron at Legion Field with first snap scheduled for 3 p.m. on Sunday.

57,"After what may have been the most exciting weekend of the college football season, only three regular-season Saturdays remain on the SEC schedule.Oddsmakers don't expect a ton of close games the rest of the way, as five of the seven SEC games next Saturday feature an opening line with one team favored by at least 12.5.Kentucky-Tennessee is the only SEC game with an opening line of less than a touchdown.Week 11 SEC linesSouth Carolina at Florida (-7), noon ET Ole Miss at Texas A&M (-12.5), noon ET Vanderbilt at Missouri (-15.5), noon ET Mississippi State at Alabama (-27), 3:30 p.m. ET Kentucky (-3.5) at Tennessee, 3:30 p.m. ET Auburn at Georgia (-13.5), 7 p.m. ET LSU (-17) at Arkansas, 7:30 p.m. ETBased on BetOnline lines as of 4:30 p.m. ET SundayWeek 11 gambling notes-Alabama (9-0) will play in the SEC Championship Game. A heavy favorite in its three remaining regular-season games, the Tide are poised to make the College Football Playoff yet again. As such, BetOnline already has posted national championship lines for Alabama-Clemson (Bama -9), Alabama-Michigan (Bama -14) and Alabama-Notre Dame ( Bama -20.5). The bets will be graded as no contest unless the matchups materialize.-Alabama survived a scare at Mississippi State last year, winning 31-24 as a 14-point favorite. The Tide's linebackers are much healthier this year. Alabama opened as a 19.5 or 20-point favorite in this game during the summer.-The under is 6-0 in Mississippi State's SEC games this year, and 12-2 dating back to the start of last season. With several Alabama skill players nursing bumps and bruises, and the Tide facing an emotional letdown after a 29-0 win in Baton Rouge, the under may be the best way to play this game.-The Deep South's Oldest Rivalry featured a line between Georgia -3 and Georgia -5 this summer at various sportsbooks. Auburn won outright last year as a 2.5-point road underdog in the regular season, and lost as a 1.5-point underdog in last year's SEC Championship Game. This is Auburn's largest underdog spot against Georgia since 2012, when the Tigers lost 38-0 as a 15.5-point home underdog.-Every SEC team is between 6-3 and 4-5 ATS ... except for Ole Miss, which is 3-6 ATS. Ole Miss also is on a 3-12 ATS streak against SEC competition. The Rebels defense has allowed 43.3 points per game during that stretch.-Texas A&M is just 5-16 ATS in November since 2013, Kevin Sumlin's second season in College Station. That includes Saturday's 28-24 loss to Auburn in which the Aggies outgained the Tigers, 421-278, but allowed two touchdowns in the final 5:14. Ole Miss could be a nice cure.-Arkansas has covered five consecutive games and is off a bye week in Chad Morris' first season as head coach. Meanwhile, LSU is licking its wounds after losing 29-0 to Alabama and watching its SEC West title hopes dissolve. This may be a good spot to back the Razorbacks against a double-digit number.-The middle of the SEC is astonishingly competitive this year. In my power ratings, which take into account which team would win if two programs played a seven-game series on a neutral field, I have the SEC teams ranked as follows nationally: No. 1 Alabama, No. 6 Georgia, No. 7 LSU, No. 17 Kentucky, No. 18 Missouri, No. 19 Mississippi State, No. 20 Texas A&M, No. 21 Florida, No. 22 South Carolina, No. 24 Auburn, No. 34 Ole Miss, No. 49 Vanderbilt, No. 55 Tennessee and No. 69 Arkansas.

65,"When Arkansas State athletics director Terry Mohajir went to hire a football coach six years ago for a program that had been a reliable launching pad to the Power Five, he looked to the staff of one of the most profitable athletic departments in the country. At the time, Texas offensive coordinator Bryan Harsin wasn’t just a highly regarded rising assistant in college football, he was also attainable for a Sun Belt program whose total athletic budget is roughly one-fifth of schools like Texas. “He was making ($700,000) and that was pretty high,” Mohajir said. “It was pretty good money, but I was able to pay him more to be a head coach.” Fueled by an explosion in the cost of hiring and retaining top-level assistants, however, the economics of grooming the next generation of head coaches has been turned on its head in less than a decade. Whereas only five assistants in the country were making $1 million or more five years ago, that number has now exploded to 21 in the latest USA TODAY Sports college coaching salary survey, with eight of those making at least $1.5 million. Led by LSU defensive coordinator Dave Aranda, whose total basic compensation for this year is $2.5 million, the motivation for top programs to retain elite assistants has turned many of those jobs into more lucrative and potentially more secure opportunities than a significant portion of head coaching gigs in the Football Bowl Subdivision.DATABASE: Salary data for nearly every FBS assistant coach“A lot of people wanted to be head coaches because the money was so significantly different, but it’s not any more,” said Chad Chatlos, who specializes in coaching and executive searches for Ventura Partners. “So what’s the incentive unless you’re just driven to be a head coach? You’re seeing some guys say, ‘I want to just coach my defense’ without having to deal with the other stuff that comes with being a modern-day head coach.”Whereas the path to lifetime financial security in college football almost always came through success as a head coach until the last few years, the lines have recently blurred.Aranda’s contract, which is guaranteed through March 31, 2022, makes him more highly paid than four head coaches in the Pac-12 Conference. Missouri’s Barry Odom, a head coach in Aranda’s own league, the Southeastern Conference, made slightly less ($2.35 million) this season.Aranda, 42, was a little-known commodity as recently as six years ago. After working his way up from places like Cal Lutheran and Delta State to the FBS level at Utah State in 2012, his reputation blossomed when he followed Gary Anderson to Wisconsin and ran a defense that finished in the top-10 nationally for three straight seasons even though his roster wasn’t loaded with blue-chip recruits. Known for a 3-4 defensive system that confuses opponents with unique blitz packages and pre-snap deception, Aranda’s work planted a seed in the mind of former LSU coach Les Miles in the 2014 season opener against Wisconsin, which LSU won 28-24. Though the job wouldn’t come open until the end of 2015, Miles lured Aranda to Baton Rouge with the opportunity to put some of the best athletes in the country in his scheme. “We interviewed a lot of guys, but the absolute star was Dave Aranda,” Miles said at the time. “That defense was the toughest defense for us to scheme and go against (that) year.”Though Miles was fired only a few months later, Aranda had made himself so integral that the viability of LSU’s plan to promote Ed Orgeron to head coach largely hinged on making him the nation's highest-paid assistant at $1.8 million per year. Then, when Jimbo Fisher and Texas A&M attempted to hire him last year, LSU re-did his contract, giving him a fully guaranteed four-year, $10 million deal that was simply unprecedented at the time for an assistant.   “And I’m not sure they would have stopped there — that’s how valuable he is to LSU,” said Scott Roussel, who owns and operates FootballScoop, a web site that specializes in coaching transactions. “It’s a big, big business, and a systemic breakdown that could occur without one of those (elite coordinators) is potentially more costly than the $2.5 million in salary or versus the salary you’d have to pay somebody else. You run a huge risk if you lose one of those guys. That’s how an athletic director is looking at it.”Taking a pay cut for a promotion?The size and security of Aranda’s deal doesn’t necessarily entrench him on Orgeron’s coaching staff forever. But it does make Aranda, and other superstar coordinators, much harder to attain these days, even for schools that can offer head coaching opportunities.Clemson defensive coordinator Brent Venables ($2.2 million this year) has been notoriously picky if not outright dismissive of job openings. Meanwhile, other highly-paid defensive coordinators like Auburn’s Kevin Steele ($2.05 million), Texas A&M’s Mike Elko ($1.8 million), Oregon’s Jim Leavitt ($1.7 million) and Ohio State’s Greg Schiano ($1.5 million) are less likely to become head coaches because, in large part, of how much money they make. In the American Athletic Conference, which has tried to keep pace with the Power Five, the pay scale has mostly been between $1 million to $2 million for head coaches. The market in both the Mountain West and Conference USA has been roughly $1.5 million on the high end with some head coaches on the low end barely clearing the $500,000 bar. In the Sun Belt, where Mohajir has helped build a consistent winner through aggressive fundraising and facilities improvements, his head coach Blake Anderson ($825,000), would barely be among the 35 highest-paid assistants this year in the Power Five. If Anderson left this year, it’s possible Mohajir wouldn’t be able to draw the attention of many of those assistants — even for a job that previously launched Hugh Freeze, Gus Malzahn and Harsin to promotions. “When a head coach has a good coordinator, they don't want to lose them,” Mohajir said. “At the end of the day, if a guy is making $1.5 million, does he want to come to a Sun Belt or Conference USA school and make $1 million? Do you want to take half the pay to be a head coach?”The irony, though, is that the path for advancement in the coaching business hasn’t necessarily changed much. A year ago, out of the 13 new hires made by Power Five schools, eight had previous head coaching experience at a Football Bowl Subdivision school. The year before, five Power Five schools hired their new coaches directly from the mid-major ranks. Though it's certainly not unheard of for high-profile coordinators to move directly into elite head coaching jobs — Georgia’s Kirby Smart and Oklahoma’s Lincoln Riley would be the most recent successful examples — stories like Matt Campbell going from Toledo to Iowa State or Dino Babers turning around Syracuse after he did the same at Bowling Green remain the bread-and-butter of the business. “There is so much pressure on ADs at every level to make sure they get a coach who is going to be successful that I think ADs still prefer a head coach that has head coaching experience,” North Texas athletics director Wren Baker said. “I think it’s most coaches’ dreams to be in a job one day where they can make a lot of money and compete for a national championship. And if you want to do that, the best path to get there is still being a Group of Five head coach.”Under Baker, North Texas has pushed to invest resources in coaching and made Seth Littrell the highest-paid coach in C-USA this year at $1.425 million. However, winning nine games each of the last two years has put Littrell on the radar of bigger programs, and like most athletics directors in his position, Baker monitors the market in case he has an opening to fill. If Littrell left, it’s possible that some coaches Baker might naturally be interested in because of their success as assistants might already make more money. “It certainly puts another wrinkle into the whole process,” Baker said. “I don’t see it as vastly limiting your pool, but it’s definitely a factor."" But following Baker’s point about the appeal of hiring a Group of Five head coach and perhaps influenced by prominent Power Five assistants' pay, two schools from the Group of Five have looked to the Football Championship Subdivision for their openings. This week East Carolina hired Mike Houston, who led James Madison to the FCS national title in 2016, and Charlotte named Will Healy its head coach after he revived Austin Peay’s program.Less risk, less pressureWhile the salaries, of course, reflect how much revenue top college football programs generate, they also indicate the value of specialization. A decade ago, a coach might have to chase jobs that were out of their comfort zone because the financial difference was so significant. Now, someone who is really good at one thing can become wealthy just doing that one thing.For some people, the upside of being a coordinator now may be even greater than becoming a head coach. Signaling how much it wants to keep Venables, Clemson reworked his deal to $2 million a year in February and five months later extended his contract to five years through January 2023 and added a retention/deferred compensation plan in the form of a life insurance policy for a package worth $11.6 million.“In a business that is highly unstable traditionally, now you’ve got a school saying we’re going to pay you 3-4 years guaranteed at $1.3 million, that means a lot to be able to give back some stability to their wives and kids,” Chatlos said.There are also fewer external pressures in terms of fundraising or media obligations (Aranda, for instance, is off-limits to the media during the season), and nobody is going to fly a banner over the stadium demanding that the school fire a coordinator. Though safe harbors don’t really exist in coaching, there is a certainly appeal to a lifestyle where the entire focus goes to the on-field product.“If you love to coach and you love to work with young men and specifically mold them for their future, which a lot of these guys really love that stuff, being a position coach or a coordinator is a really good place to be right now,” Roussel said. “A lot less risk, a lot less pressure than the head coaching seat for sure.”The other side of that, though, could have some significant implications for the industry. As assistant salaries grow and programs like Clemson, Ohio State and LSU invest in coaching staff stability, what's the incentive for promising young coaches to go prove themselves at smaller programs?Before Mohajir hired Anderson, who had been the offensive coordinator at North Carolina, he recalled interviewing another highly-rated assistant at a top-five program who was already making more money than Arkansas State had allocated for the position. Mohajir, who declined to name the coach, said he could tell during the conversation that the possibility of taking a pay cut was going to be an issue and they went their separate ways. He said that experience, however, wouldn’t stop him from inquiring about Power Five assistants who make more than $1 million next time he has an opening.  After all, there are still a lot of people who want to be head coaches and only 130 of these highly-coveted FBS jobs, even though half of them have financial limits due to the inequity in television money. “To be very candid, the ones that are willing to take the pay cut are the ones that are the most attractive because you know they really, really want to be the head coach,” Mohajir said. “It’s a challenge sometimes. If you want to hire Dave Aranda, is he going to come work in the Sun Belt for $1 million when he has a (four-) year contract? If he takes your job, you know he really wants the job.” ",0.0

67,"The Pac-12’s financial position among the Power Five conferences has been slipping in recent years as newer television agreements have taken hold and the Pac-12 Networks have fallen short of revenue expectations amid distribution challenges.The conference did not help itself during its 2018 fiscal year, recording a $12.5 million drop in total revenue to just under $497 million, according to a new federal tax return it released Monday.The decline comes from the conference’s inability to increase its income enough to fully offset getting virtually no payout from the Rose Bowl that year. It’s an occurrence that will happen every third year, when the event becomes a College Football Playoff semifinal rather than a game set to feature the Pac-12 champion. According to the conference, as the numbers are reported on the tax document, the Rose Bowl payout difference was about $36.5 million.The decrease meant per-school distributions, as reported on the tax document, fell to roughly $29.5 million – about $5 million per school less than what the Big 12 has reported and far behind what the Southeastern and Big Ten conferences have reported.In a separate statement, the Pac-12 said its actual cash distributions to schools in fiscal 2018 averaged $31.3 million because the conference had withheld money in prior years in anticipation of a need to compensate for the drop in the Rose Bowl money.The return also showed that commissioner Larry Scott was credited with nearly $5.3 million in total compensation for the 2017 calendar year. That represents a $500,000 increase in Scott’s compensation, compared to what was reported for him for 2016. Scott also continued to have the benefit of a nearly $1.9 million loan from the conference.The Big Ten reported last week that Jim Delany was credited with just over $5.5 million in total compensation for 2017. (Under IRS rules, a non-profit organization must report its revenue and expense data based on its fiscal year, but it must report compensation data based on the calendar year completed during the fiscal year. The Pac-12's fiscal year ends June 30.)The Big Ten reported that its 12 longest-standing members received roughly $54 million apiece in fiscal 2018. Maryland and Rutgers received smaller revenue-share amounts, but both schools also received loans from the conference against future revenue shares.In February, the Southeastern Conference reported that an average of $43.7 million was distributed to the 13 member schools that received full shares. Mississippi did not get a full share because its football team was banned from postseason play.In the Pac-12's statement that accompanied its tax return, it noted that its financial position relative to other conferences' does not take into account the equity value of the Pac-12 Networks, the conference's fully self-owned television and video content provider. And Scott said during a conference call Monday that this makes it ""very hard to compare"" the Pac-12's financials with those of other conferences.A conference spokesman said via email the conference ""cannot place an exact value on the equity"" value of the Pac-12 Networks. However, the conference has been working on attempting to sell a stake in the Networks.      Scott was among 11 current or former Pac-12 conference executives who were credited with more than $430,000 in total compensation in 2017. Many of those employees were involved with the Pac-12 Networks. Pac-12 Networks president Mark Shuken, who began his job in September 2017, was shown with nearly $280,000 in compensation for the year – an amount that annualizes to about $840,000.The conference's new tax return provided more detailed notes to its compensation figures than it has in the past. Among the new information:-Scott “may travel first class when warranted, at his discretion. He may also charter aircraft with a predetermined annual budget total.” A conference spokesman said in an email to USA TODAY that Scott can use charter aircraft for conference business only.-Scott “may receive certain taxable benefits that include a gross up to cover the tax. Both the benefit value and the tax gross up are included as compensation to the commissioner for tax purposes.”-Pac-12 Networks sales managers “receive bonuses based on advertising and sponsorship revenue generated.”",0.0

69,"A records search by USA TODAY Sports indicates Muhammad Ali never legally changed his name from Cassius Clay — and lived in an era when he didn’t have to.Officials in Kentucky, where Ali was born, and in Illinois, where Ali lived when he adopted his Muslim name in 1964, said there are no records showing Ali legally changed his name from his given name, Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., before he died June 3.A copy of Ali’s birth certificate, which was obtained by USA TODAY Sports, shows no updated name, but it does show a spelling error: Cassuis, rather than Cassius.Roxanne Williamson, a spokesperson for the Social Security Administration, said a legal name change was not required in the 1960s. A person who wanted to use another name could simply assume the new one.Obama: What Muhammad Ali meant to me“In 1964, the Social Security Administration (SSA) did not require an applicant to provide documented proof of his or her name or changes to his or her legal name,’’ Williamson said in an email. “An individual’s name was listed on his or her Social Security card based solely on his or her allegation. Many Social Security Numbers (SSNs), including SSN cards, were issued in the name provided by the applicant and could include an applicant’s nickname.“SSA’s only requirement was that the applicant submit acceptable evidence that established his or her identity.”The Social Security Administration tightened the policy in 2005 after Congressional action spurred by 9/11 and terrorism concerns. The change requires Social Security numbers or cards to be in the applicant’s legal name, Williamson said.Hana Ali, one of the boxer’s children, said Ali’s wife, Lonnie, told her the legendary boxer had never legally changed his name. But family spokesman Bob Gunnel disputed that, saying, “Lonnie wasn’t aware one way or the other because it’s inconsequential.’’Veronica Porche, the third of Ali’s four wives, said she wasn’t surprised to learn there are no records showing Ali changed his name legally, which requires a court decree.What I learned about Muhammad Ali over 50 years“Back then, within the black Muslim community, there was a lot of talk about not needing to go according to the white man’s law,” said Porche, who was married to Ali from 1977 to 1986. “Just as a group they talked about that, so I heard them say that.”Porche also pointed out that she and Ali were married in a Muslim ceremony in 1974 while Ali still was married to his second wife and preparing to fight George Foreman in what was billed as “The Rumble in the Jungle.""In 1977, after Ali was divorced from his second wife, Porche and Ali had a second wedding ceremony in Los Angeles. But Porche said it was her idea, in part so their marriage would be recognized by U.S. law. Ali had expressed no interest in a non-Muslim ceremony, according to Porche.Sonji Roi, who was Ali’s first wife and married to the former heavyweight champion when he changed his name in 1964, died in 2005.Khalilah Ali, who was Ali’s second wife and married to the boxer from 1967 to 1976, said she had no information indicating Ali had legally changed his name.“Not on my watch he didn’t,’’ she said.After being told that records indicate her father never legally changed his name, Hana Ali said, “That was a shock. … I’ve never heard that.""Gunnel, the Ali family spokesman, said the boxer’s tax bills, real estate records and driver’s license all were issued in the name of Muhammad Ali.“Every single legal document from the United States government came to him in the name of Muhammad Ali,’’ Gunnel said. “So as far as Muhammad Ali was concerned, his name was changed.’’GALLERY: 30 PHOTOS OF MUHAMMAD ALI",0.0

""He has no business being around this small school with an attitude like that.""Washington County Superintendent John Dickey confirmed to media outlets that Hardin has been put on leave while he fully investigates the incident. He did not return a voicemail from AL.com on Thursday afternoon.Guy admitted that her son, who is on the football team, played a part in starting the altercation, which happened after school on Monday.""My son did wrong,"" she said. ""Don't get me wrong. He did the throat chop to the coach and to two other boys. It is my understanding that this has happened before and usually the coaches come after them and do it back playfully. But what happened this time was more than playing.""Guy said Hardin chased her son down, grabbed him by the shirt and put him up against the fence. He then put her son on the ground and put his knee on him. That part of the incident was caught on video by another student.""My son ran about 10 yards and, when he looked back, the coach was walking,"" she said. ""He came up to my son without saying a word, grabbed him by the shirt and slammed him against the fence. My son said he swatted his hand away and told him to take his hands off him.

72,"Selection Sunday is quickly approaching, and it's win or go to the NIT for a good chunk of NCAA tournament bubble teams competing in conference tournaments. With only seven spots open, a dozen or so teams with borderline credentials are looking to enhance their résumés enough to meet the selection committee's demands.Here's a look at the winners and losers from this weekend's conference tournament action: WinnersFlorida: The Gators (19-14, 9-9 SEC) essentially punched their ticket to the NCAAs with a 76-73 win over top-seeded LSU in the SEC tournament quarterfinals on Friday. After starting the week as one of the ""first four teams out,"" Florida handled Arkansas in the second round before nabbing a much-needed Quadrant 1 (top-30 home, top-50 neutral, top-75 road) win over LSU to go with a top-35 NET score. Florida's 65-62 loss to Auburn in the SEC semifinals is its 15th — another sign of a weak bubble if 15-loss teams are getting in. ► Updated Saturday afternoonMinnesota: The Gophers (21-12, 9-11 Big Ten) were inching near the ""last four in"" at the start of the Big Ten tournament but capitalized on their opportunities, first getting past a dangerous Penn State team in overtime in the Big Ten tourney's second round and then upsetting Purdue in the quarterfinals on Friday. Despite getting blown out by Michigan in the semifinals on Saturday, those two Quad 1 victories, the Purdue win in particular, should move Minnesota comfortably away from bubble chaos. Consider them a lock for the NCAAs. ► Updated Saturday afternoon. Utah State: The Aggies (28-6, 15-3 Mountain West) were relatively safe but still on the bubble before the Mountain West tournament, but three consecutive wins over San Diego State, Fresno State and New Mexico helped this team avoid any Selection Sunday sweating by claiming the Mountain West's automatic bid. More than that, Utah State's win over San Diego State actually helped out other fringe teams — removing the opportunity for a bid thief — so the teams in the ""last four in"" stratosphere can thank the Aggies. ► Updated Saturday nightLosersArizona State: The Sun Devils (22-10, 12-6 Pac-12) have now been thrust right back to where they were last year — hoping for no bid thieves as one of ""the last four in"" — as a result of Friday's 79-75 loss to Oregon in the Pac-12 tournament semifinals. It's a good thing ASU got past UCLA with an 83-72 win over UCLA in the earlier round Thursday, otherwise they'd be on the other side of the bubble. What's still scary about this résumé are two Quadrant 4 losses, and it remains to be seen how heavy the committee focuses on the NET — where ASU is in the high 60s compared to its mid-30s RPI that would have locked it up weeks ago in years' past. ► Updated Friday nightExpected seed: No. 11 play-inOhio State: The Buckeyes (19-14, 8-12 Big Ten) bowed out of the Big Ten tournament with a loss to Michigan State in the quarterfinals on Friday. But Ohio State might have already played itself into the field by escaping Indiana on Thursday in a potential bubble-elimination game between borderline teams. Ultimately, the committee should take into account that OSU's three consecutive losses to close out the regular season were all without Kaleb Wesson. The sophomore big man's return in the Big Ten tournament showed what a different team OSU can be with him in the lineup. ► Updated Friday afternoon Expected seed: No. 11 play-inTemple: The Owls (23-9, 13-5 American) were upset by Wichita State in the AAC tournament quarterfinals, and now it gets interesting as they've fallen to one of the ""last four in"" range and are in danger of missing the field. Temple's only got two Quad 1 wins and could've really used another one to help offset a non-conference strength of schedule in the 200s and a NET score in the 50s. ► Updated Friday night.Expected seed: No. 11 play-inXavier: The Musketeers (18-15, 9-9 Big East) came up short in the Big East tournament semifinals, falling 71-67 to Villanova in overtime. It's a make-or-break type loss that likely will keep Xavier out of the NCAAs despite a late charge that saw them knock off Creighton, 63-61 -- winning six of their last eight. This team is on the outside looking i due to a NET score in the 70s and just too many total losses. ► Updated Friday night.Expected seed: First four outAlabama: The Crimson Tide (18-15, 8-10 SEC) couldn't put up much of a fight against a dominant Kentucky team they upset earlier in the year, falling 73-55 in the SEC tournament quarterfinals. It's a respectable loss and 'Bama got a much-needed Quadrant 1 (top-50 neutral court) win over Ole Miss in the SEC tourney quarterfinals before that Thursday to make it interesting. That's still only three marquee wins, though. A top-20 strength of schedule is a determining factor in keeping this team close.  ► Updated Friday nightExpected seed: First four outTCU: Although the Horned Frogs (20-13, 7-11 Big 12) got past Oklahoma State on Wednesday, they came up short in a 70-61 loss to Kansas State the next day of the Big 12 tournament and removed the chance to enhance their profile. A top-30 strength of schedule plays in their favor, but playing in the Big 12 -- the country's best NET conference -- should equate to more than three Quad 1 wins. ► Updated ThursdaySt. John's: The Red Storm (21-12, 8-10 Big East) didn't come up with a tourney-locking signature victory and definitely didn't do anything to improve a NET score in the 60s after getting steamrolled by Marquette in the Big East tourney quarterfinals on Thursday. The good news is that St. John's avoided losing to DePaul in the earlier round. ► Updated ThursdayGeorgetown: The Hoyas (19-13, 9-9 Big East) started its Big East tournament pursuit as one of the ""last four in"" and ended it as one of the ""first four out"" thanks to a 73-57 loss to Seton Hall in the Big East tournament quarterfinals. The Hoyas have five Quadrant 1 wins but a non-conference strength of schedule that ranks 244th. It will be close on Sunday. ► Updated ThursdayExpected seed: First four outIndiana: The Hoosiers (17-15, 8-12 Big Ten) will challenge the committee, because after Thursday's Big Ten tournament loss to Ohio State, this team now has 15 losses. How could a 15-loss team make the NCAAs? By winning six Quadrant 1 (top-30 home, top-75 road) games. Coach Archie Miller summed up his team's case: ""I think the one thing in this stage when you're comparing everybody — can you beat a team in the tournament? When you're able to beat a Marquette or Louisville, you're able to get a Michigan State twice. You're able to get Wisconsin here lately. So are we capable? Yes. Did we do enough? I'm not sure."" ► Updated ThursdayExpected seed: Next four outCreighton: The Bluejays (18-14, 9-9 Big East) fell to Xavier in the Big East tournament's first round, which likely means they're heading to the NIT. In spite of five consecutive wins before that, there just isn't enough on this résumé to sway the committee. ► Updated ThursdayExpected seed: Next four outNorth Carolina State: The Wolfpack bowed out of the ACC tournament by falling to top-seeded Virginia, 76-56, on Thursday. That's a respectable loss, and N.C. State even led at halftime, so that aids its overall NET score. It encapsulates a lot of N.C. State's résumé, too. The Wolfpack have a horrid RPI, but a top-35 NET ranking. Ultimately, it might be the non-conference strength of schedule that ranks 352nd keeping this team out. ► Updated ThursdayExpected seed: Next four outTexas: The Longhorns (16-16, 8-10) concluded the Big 12 tournament with a 65-57 quarterfinal loss to Kansas. They now have a whopping 16 losses and are done playing. Still helping their profile is a top-40 NET score that's far better than an RPI in the 60s. ► Updated ThursdayExpected seed: Slim chanceLost earlier this week/last week► Belmont: Lost in the Ohio Valley Conference tourney final to Murray State, currently last four in. ► UNC-Greensboro: Lost in the Southern Conference tourney final to Wofford, currently first four out. ► Clemson: Lost in the ACC tournament to North Carolina State on Wednesday, currently next four out. ► Lipscomb: Lost in the Atlantic Sun tourney final to Liberty, currently next four out. ► Furman: Lost in the Southern Conference tourney semifinals to UNC-Greensboro, currently slim chance.     ",0.0
73,"Former Alabama All-American AJ McCarron is joining the Houston Texans, the Houston Chronicle and NFL Network reported on Tuesday night.McCarron became a free agent on Thursday, when the Oakland Raiders released the quarterback with a season left on his contract. Had McCarron been on the Raiders’ roster on Friday, he would have been due a $1.9 million bonus and $1.1 million of his $3 million salary for the 2019 season would have become guaranteed.The Houston Chronicle reported McCarron would sign a one-year, $3 million contract.McCarron will join Deshaun Watson as the quarterbacks on Houston's roster. In his second NFL season, Watson started every game in the 2018 campaign for the Texans, leading Houston to an 11-5 regular-season record and the AFC South crown before the team’s season ended in a 21-7 loss to the Indianapolis Colts during the Wild-Card Weekend of the NFL playoffs.Brandon Weeden and former Wenonah High School and UAB standout Joe Webb served as Watson’s backups in 2018, although neither threw a pass. Both are unrestricted free agents, and neither is on the Houston roster.McCarron earned All-State honors in football and baseball at St. Paul's Episcopal in Mobile and helped the Saints win the AHSAA Class 5A football championship in 2007.McCarron was the starting quarterback for the Alabama teams that won the BCS national championships for the 2011 and 2012 seasons.With the Crimson Tide, McCarron became the school's all-time passing leader, won the Maxwell Award and the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award and finished second in the Heisman Trophy balloting for the 2013 season.McCarron entered the NFL as a fifth-round selection in the 2014 NFL Draft and spent four seasons as a backup to Andy Dalton with the Cincinnati Bengals. When Dalton suffered a broken thumb in 2015, McCarron started the final three games of the regular season and a postseason game, nearly leading the Bengals to their first playoff victory in 25 years before the Pittsburgh Steelers rallied in the waning moments for an 18-16 win. McCarron joined the Buffalo Bills as a free agent last year. He competed with Nathan Peterman, Buffalo's backup in 2017, and Josh Allen, the seventh player picked in April's draft, to become Buffalo's starting quarterback.Buffalo picked Peterman to be its starter. As NFL teams reduced their 90-player preseason rosters to the regular-season limit of 53 on Sept. 1, Buffalo traded McCarron to Oakland for a fifth-round pick in the 2019 NFL Draft.McCarron served as Derek Carr's backup during the 2018 season. He took 12 snaps and threw three passes for the Raiders.During his NFL career, McCarron has completed 87-of-136 passes for 928 yards with six touchdowns and two interceptions in 13 regular-season games.FOR MORE OF AL.COM’S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGEMark Inabinett is a sports reporter for Alabama Media Group.

76,"Georgia quarterback transfer Justin Fields is eligible to play at Ohio State this season after the NCAA approved his transfer waiver, the Buckeyes announced Friday.Fields, who played in 12 games for the Bulldogs as a true freshman in 2018, transferred to Ohio State in January and would have had to sit out this fall if not for the NCAA waiver. Rated the No. 2 overall player in the 2018 recruiting class, he is now expected to compete for the starting quarterback job with the Buckeyes this spring.“I am happy for Justin and his family,” Ohio State coach Ryan Day said. “I also want to express my appreciation to the NCAA for its assistance in getting this matter resolved efficiently and with such a positive outcome for Justin.”The 6-foot-3, 225-pound Fields was the primary back-up to Jake Fromm at Georgia in 2018. He completed 27 of 39 passes for 328 yards and four touchdowns with no interceptions and also rushed for 266 yards and four scores.According to multiple reports, Fields cited “mitigating circumstances” at Georgia in order to seek immediate eligibility at Ohio State, stemming from a September incident in which Bulldogs baseball player Adam Sasser was overheard using a racial slur in reference to Fields in the stands during a game against Tennessee. Sasser, a second-team All-SEC first baseman in 2018, was later dismissed from the team.Dwayne Haskins set Ohio State records with 4,831 passing yards and 50 touchdowns in 2018, but has entered the NFL draft. Former Buckeyes back-up Tate Martell has since transferred to Miami.Fields released the following statement on Friday:“I thank God for His guidance during this time of uncertainty. I would like to thank the NCAA for its approval of the waiver allowing me to be eligible to play football this fall. I also want to thank all those who supported and encouraged my family and me during this process. While my case was pending before the NCAA, my family and I did not feel that it was appropriate to publicly speak about the circumstances leading to my transfer. In my silence, people began to speculate, and the story took on a life of its own.“Now that this matter is concluded, I would like to clarify some facts. I have no regrets about my time at UGA and have no hard feelings for the school or football program. My overall experience at UGA was fully consistent with UGA’s commitment to diversity and inclusion. My sister is a softball player at UGA. I am still close friends with many of my UGA teammates. A part of me will always be a Georgia Bulldogs fan.“To Buckeye Nation: thank you for your warm welcome. I will work hard to represent you and The Ohio State University in a professional and respectful manner. My dad always tells me that “you can’t get to where you are going by looking in the ‘rear view mirror.’” I’m ready to move forward and embrace the next season of my life.“I will not be speaking about my transfer again. Instead, I will focus all of my attention on getting to work in the classroom and on the field – and doing whatever else I can to help my teammates as we prepare for the 2019 season.”",0.0

79,"It looks as though Mark Ingram won’t get the 90 yards he needs to become the New Orleans Saints’ career rushing leader.The Saints will sign running back Latavius Murray when NFL free agency opens on Wednesday afternoon, ESPN reported on Tuesday, which appears to leave Ingram the odd man out in the New Orleans backfield.Ingram's four-year, $16 million contract with the Saints expires at 3 p.m. CDT Wednesday. He'll become an unrestricted free agent if New Orleans does not re-sign him by then.The chances of that happening now seem remote after ESPN reported the Saints have agreed to a four-year, $14.4 million contract with Murray.Murray rushed for 578 yards and six touchdowns on 140 carries and caught 22 passes for 141 yards for the Minnesota Vikings in 2018. Murray shared running-back duties for the Vikings with Dalvin Cook, who ran for 615 yards and two touchdowns on 133 carries and caught 40 passes for 305 yards and two touchdowns in 2018.Ingram rushed for 645 yards and six touchdowns on 138 carries and caught 21 passes for 170 yards and one touchdown for the Saints in 2018. After returning from a four-game suspension to open the season, Ingram shared the running-back work with Alvin Kamara. In his second NFL season, Kamara received his second Pro Bowl invitation as he ran for 883 yards and 14 touchdowns on 194 carries and caught 81 passes for 709 yards and four touchdowns.The departure of Ingram would break up New Orleans' Boom and Zoom backfield combination, which has helped the Saints run up a 24-8 regular-season record, take two NFC South titles and win two playoff games in 2017 and 2018. But the signing of Murray would replace the 215-pound Ingram with a 230-pound running back.In five NFL seasons, Murray has run for 3,698 yards and 34 touchdowns on 899 carries and caught 128 passes for 883 yards and no touchdowns. Murray entered the NFL from Central Florida as a sixth-round selection of the Oakland Raiders in the 2013 NFL Draft. He spent his entire rookie season on injured reserve but earned a Pro Bowl invitation when he became the Raiders' starter in 2015 and ran for 1,066 yards.In eight NFL seasons, Ingram has run for 6,007 yards and 50 touchdowns on 1,321 carries and caught 228 passes for 1,598 yards and five touchdowns. A two-time Pro Bowler, Ingram set the Saints' franchise record for career rushing touchdowns in 2018 and ended the season 89 yards behind Deuce McAllister for New Orleans' all-time rushing lead. Despite their difference in experience, Ingram is only 28 days older than Murray. Both are 29 years old.Ingram became the first Alabama player to win the Heisman Trophy in 2009, when he helped the Crimson Tide win the BCS national championship.FOR MORE OF AL.COM’S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGEMark Inabinett is a sports reporter for Alabama Media Group.

84,"The NFL restored Reuben Foster to the Washington Redskins’ active roster on Friday after he’d been on the Commissioner Exempt List since Nov. 27.The NFL put the former Alabama All-American on the Commissioner Exempt List after he was arrested in Tampa, Florida, on Nov. 24. That prevented Foster from playing in the Redskins’ final five games of the 2018 season.Tampa Police arrested Foster in Florida at the San Francisco 49ers’ team hotel the night before the NFL team’s game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Elissa Ennis told police that Foster had knocked her phone from her hand, pushed her in the chest and slapped her in the face.The day before Foster's scheduled arraignment in Hillsborough, Florida, on one misdemeanor count of first-degree domestic battery on Jan. 3, the State Attorney's Office dismissed the charge and filed a notice of termination of prosecution.In announcing an end to its investigation on Friday, the NFL said: ""The evidence did not support a finding that Foster violated the NFL's Personal Conduct Policy in connection with the Tampa incident in November 2018.""Foster did not escape punishment, though.The NFL said the inside linebacker would be fined two game checks after “an assessment of his adherence to obligations arising from previous violations of league policies.” Two game checks for Foster would total $151,340 based on his 2019 salary of $1.286 million.The NFL also said Foster ""has committed to a comprehensive accountability plan developed by the league, the NFLPA and the Washington Redskins to help him grow personally and avoid future misconduct. Foster was advised that any future incidents will likely result in more substantial discipline.""In a statement released by the Redskins, Foster said: “I am grateful to the Washington Redskins and the NFL for giving me this second chance. I appreciate the support I have received from the league, my team and my union to help me succeed. I want to thank Commissioner (Roger) Goodell for the time that he has spent with me and for his understanding of me as a person. I accept the NFL’s decision and want to say that I am truly sorry for my past actions and the people who may have been hurt by them. Going forward, I will follow the plan outlined for me and work hard to earn back the trust of my teammates, the NFL, NFL fans and the community. I know that my success is all up to me, and I am committed to not letting you down.”Foster had been arrested twice earlier in 2018.On Jan. 12, 2018, Foster was arrested in Tuscaloosa and charged with second-degree possession of marijuana. The marijuana charge was dismissed in May after Foster participated in a pretrial diversion program.On Feb. 11, 2018, Foster was arrested and charged with felony domestic violence, forcefully attempting to prevent a victim from reporting a crime and possession of an assault weapon in Los Gatos, California. As with Foster's November arrest, Elissa Ennis was the woman involved in the February incident.On May 23, a judge dismissed the first two of those charges after Ennis testified she had fabricated her claims against Foster. In December, Ennis told ABC’s “Good Morning, America” that she was lying when she’d said she was lying and that the February incident occurred as she’d told the police initially.Foster pleaded no contest to unlawful possession of an assault weapon on June 6. He was sentenced to two years of probation with 30 days on a sheriff’s work program, which was waived to allow Foster to perform 240 hours of community service instead. Foster also had to pay $235 in fines and fees and surrender the gun.The NFL responded by suspending Foster for the first two games of the 2018 regular season for violating the league’s Personal Conduct Policy and its Policy and Program on Substances of Abuse.The 49ers stood behind Foster through those incidents. But San Francisco released him after his arrest in November. That allowed Washington to claim him off the league’s waiver wire.The Redskins will begin their offseason program on Monday, and the NFL said Foster ""may fully participate in all team activities.""In a statement released by the Redskins, team president Bruce Allen said: ""Everyone in this league is held to a higher standard. Reuben understands that his past actions have led a lot of people to doubt him, and he has committed to doing the work necessary to earn the trust of his teammates, our great fans and the NFL.""The Redskins have put in place a comprehensive responsibility-and-accountability plan to help Reuben be successful on and off the field. Elements of this plan include individual counseling, a structured living arrangement, weekly meetings with the club player-engagement director, weekly meetings with our team chaplain and targeted community-service engagements.“We have been very clear with Reuben that his past does not have to determine his future -- but the responsibility is squarely on him to change. Reuben must fully adhere to the plan we have developed for him. Reuben knows that we simply will not tolerate any future conduct that is detrimental to the Washington Redskins organization or to the NFL.”Foster was Alabama's Class 6A Lineman of the Year for the 2012 season at Auburn High School. He won the Butkus Award as the nation's best collegiate linebacker in 2016 at Alabama.Foster entered the NFL with the 49ers as the 31st player picked in the 2017 draft. Foster missed six of San Francisco’s first eight games during his rookie season because of the injuries.

The Patriots wrapped up the draft with their smallest class in franchise history. That doesn’t mean the team will lack rookies when OTAs kick off later this month. Last week, the Patriots signed a bunch of undrafted free agents.
A total of 19 undrafted players have been brought to Foxboro for offseason workouts, filling out the team’s 90-man roster. As the Patriots go through organized team activities, minicamp and training camp, one of the bigger story lines will be if any of the undrafted players can land a spot on the 53-man roster.
It doesn’t look like there’s room for any rookie to make an impact, but it wouldn’t be another Patriots season without at least one undrafted player making his mark and eventually earning a roster spot.
Last season, cornerback Jonathan Jones and running back D.J. Foster landed on the 53-man roster. Defensive tackle Woodrow Hamilton also spent time on the active roster. By the time Super Bowl LI rolled around, Jones moved past second-round pick Cyrus Jones as the team’s fourth cornerback. In 2015, players like David Andrews, Justin Coleman, Brandin King and Chris Harper all worked their way on to the roster. Now, Andrews is the team’s starting center and King is a special teams standout.
In 2014, it was Malcolm Butler, who gave hope to undrafted free agents everywhere.
BYU linebacker Harvey Langi might have the best chance of sticking with the Patriots.
Langi was well-connected to the Patriots in the pre-draft process. When the draft concluded, Langi was the team's top priority and signed him to a big contract for an undrafted player. The linebacker is set to earn $115,000 in guaranteed money, which is more than 2015 sixth-round pick Elandon Roberts got a year ago.
Langi is an athletic linebacker and even played running back last season for BYU. Langi will compete with Jonathan Freeny, Roberts and Shea McClellin for a roster spot.
By giving Langi more money than rookies who were drafted in the sixth and seventh rounds, the Patriots made him their most expensive undrafted free agent in recent memory. It’s hard to find another undrafted player who was paid more than Jonathan Jones at $35,000 in guaranteed money.
Langi, however, isn’t the only undrafted player to get paid like he was drafted. The Patriots gave Wyoming tight end Jacob Hollister $90,000 in guaranteed money, which is more than some seventh-round picks. Hollister caught 32 passes for 515 yards and seven touchdowns last season. He will have to beat out James O'Shaughnessy and Matt Lengel for a roster spot.
Another high earner in this year’s undrafted class is cornerback D.J. Killings ($31,000). He finished with three interceptions last season.
The Patriots signed six undrafted defensive backs. Kenny Moore of Valdosta State looks like an ideal slot corner, a spot that’s open after the departure of Logan Ryan. Hard-hitting safety Darmarius Travis sounds like a Patrick Chung clone as someone who plays in the box. Then there’s Richmond safety David Jones, who will be one of the most athletic rookies in camp.
Although the wide receiver depth chart is star-studded, Northwestern’s Austin Carr has a chance to prove doubters wrong after finishing last season as the most accomplished receiver in the Big Ten, leading the conference in receptions, receiving yards and touchdowns as a senior.
It will be an uphill climb for all the rookies, but if history is any indication, one or two of these players could end up helping the Patriots.

93,"Kawhi Leonard wanted to play with another star after all.Just turns out, it was a player no one expected: Paul George. And with a team that supposedly was behind the Los Angeles Lakers and Toronto Raptors in the Leonard sweepstakes: the Los Angeles Clippers.And now Leonard and George — who both had expressed an interest in returning to Southern California where they grew up — have teamed up to alter the balance of power in the NBA and make the Clippers a championship contender.To get the commitment from Leonard, the Clippers acquired George from Oklahoma City for multiple first-round draft picks, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Danilo Gallinari.The news — it didn’t break until 1:53 a.m. ET Saturday — was a shocker in a wild free agency period that had players changing teams left and right as soon as free agency began on Sunday.Leonard, the MVP of the Finals for Toronto, was the last All-Star caliber player available, and the Clippers gave up significant assets to make this Leonard-George pairing possible.But the message from Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank and Doc Rivers is clear: they are going for a championship in 2019-20 with a roster that features Leonard, George, Patrick Beverley, Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell.ESPN reported Leonard and George met trying to find a way to make this happen, and the Clippers did what they had to do to make it happen. Don’t forget, Leonard and George were almost teammates in 2011-12. The Pacers drafted Leonard in 2011, a year after they selected George. But they traded Leonard to San Antonio. Almost a decade later, they’re on the same team.The Clippers — yep the Los Angeles Clippers of Michael Olowokandi, and 12- and 10-win seasons and Donald Sterling — really pulled this off.This is a monumental moment — perhaps the biggest? — in Clippers history, and the unexpected moves have a direct impact on four teams (the Clippers, Lakers, Thunder and Toronto Raptors) and an indirect impact on the rest of the league, especially playoff teams who think they can make a run at the title this season.The Clippers won big; the Lakers lost and will have to fill roster slots with whoever is left in free agency; the Raptors are disappointed but they have their championship and now must contemplate their future; and the Thunder are headed for a rebuild, prompting questions about Russell Westbrook’s future with OKC.Golden State and Houston will have to figure out how they don’t get left behind, and Milwaukee and Philadelphia see an opening to win the East.But right now and perhaps all next season, the center of the NBA will be in Los Angeles where the Lakers-Clippers rivalry has real stakes with Leonard and George in one locker room at Staples Center and LeBron James and Anthony Davis in another.The Clippers have been after Leonard for more than a year, and it seemed like for the longest time, they were the favorite to sign him in free agency. But then, it looked like maybe that wouldn’t happen. Toronto did everything right to re-sign him, and the Lakers offered the opportunity to play alongside James and Davis.NBA fans in the Eastern time zone were in for a surprise when they awoke Saturday morning.The NBA changed drastically in the past week, culminating with moves no one saw coming.

95,"The New England Patriots picked a quarterback Saturday. What that means remains to be seen.Near the end of the fourth round of the NFL draft, with the 133rd selection overall, the reigning Super Bowl champions selected Auburn's Jarrett Stidham — who's actually the ninth quarterback Bill Belichick and Co. have taken since Tom Brady quietly arrived with the 199th pick of the 2000 draft.Normally, a passer coming off the board in Round 4 wouldn't generate much hubbub. But the Patriots' drafting acumen combined with Brady's advancing age (he'll be 42 in August) and fact backup Brian Hoyer is unsigned beyond 2019 makes this a story worth monitoring.Stidham's college career began at Baylor, but he transferred in the wake of the school's sexual abuse scandal and firing of coach Art Briles after what was also an injury-plagued freshman season. During his two seasons at Auburn, Stidham completed 63.6% of his passes for 5,952 yards with 36 TDs and 11 INTs.He quietly had a very impressive showing at the scouting combine in February, impressing several observers with his throwing session and posting a not unimpressive 4.81 40 time.Stidham (6-2, 218 pounds) comes in the mold of a classic drop-back pro passer, fairly accurate and someone who can operate from under center, his mobility a nice bonus. He has a reputation for being a smart guy who generally makes good decisions on the field and throws a nice ball with good touch even if he can't necessarily fire it through a brick wall — quite a few traits that sound reminiscent of a certain six-time Super Bowl champion.""Tom Brady is obviously a great player and, from what I’ve heard, a great teammate. So I’m just looking forward to spending some time with him,"" said Stidham. ""Just being able to sit there and soak up everything that he’s gone through and pick his brain here and there about different things. ... It’s going to be great and I’m really looking forward to it.""Brady, who's currently under contract for one more year himself, has openly expressed a desire to play into his mid-forties. Even though New England's offense became more reliant on the run late last season, he hasn't shown any signs that suggest an immediate dropoff is forthcoming.But with Stidham presumably coming to Foxborough for at least the next four years, maybe he winds up as the heir apparent that Jimmy Garoppolo, Jacoby Brissett, Matt Cassel and others ultimately were not.But Stidham doesn't seem to be feeling any of that pressure.""I’m sure everybody wants to be as good as Tom Brady one day,"" he said. ""I’ve got to take it one day at a time, and that’s what I’m going to do and I’m going to work as absolutely hard as I can to make sure I can do whatever it is to help this organization out.""***Follow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis ",0.0

He revealed that Knight was “not well.”""I hesitate to say anything about that right now because Coach Knight is not well,"" Fischer told the radio hosts. ""He's going through some major issues and it hurts me to even talk about it just because a man with that kind of a mind, who was so tremendous at coaching the game of basketball, and you know, at the age that we get to at this point in our lives, you want to keep thinking that that brain is never going to go away, and it appears that's a real problem for him right now and in the sense of what he's dealing with.""PENNSYLVANIA UNIVERSITY BASKETBALL TEAM DON OPPONENT’S UNIFORMS AFTER FORGETTING THEIR OWN DURING TITLE GAME“So I can’t answer that question,” he continued. “I wish he would come back.

99,"Former Alabama basketball coach Mark Gottfried has been linked to alleged cash payments to a player while he was coaching at North Carolina State, according to a report Friday by ESPN.com.Gottfried, now in his first season at Cal State-Northridge, was implicated in court filings by the attorney of Orlando Early, his former assistant at both Alabama and N.C. State, according to the report. Early’s attorney alleges that on one occasion Gottfried handed Early two envelopes that Early understood to contain cash, with instructions to deliver them to the trainer of Dennis Smith Jr., a star guard who was ACC Rookie of the Year for the Wolfpack in 2016-17 and who now plays for the New York Knicks.Gottfried’s name also surfaced in connection with the ongoing federal investigation into college basketball corruption last March, when the FBI subpoenaed various documents and cell phone records from Gottfried’s time at N.C. State. Gottfried, who was fired after six seasons at N.C. State in 2017, had been hired at CSUN less than a week prior.Gottfried denied the latest allegations through his attorney Scott Tompsett, who released the following statement to ESPN:""The statement being reported on is false and conflicts with the sworn testimony of the government's lead witness in the trial last fall. Specifically, at trial, T.J. Gassnola testified, under penalty of perjury, that he did not discuss the payment to Dennis Smith with anyone at N.C. State other than one assistant coach. Thus, the statement being reported on as it refers to Mr. Gottfried is not corroborated by a single shred of evidence and it conflicts with the sworn testimony of the government's lead witness at the trial last fall.""Gottfried was born in Ohio but played his high school basketball at UMS-Wright in Mobile, where his father, Joe, was the longtime athletics director at South Alabama. The younger Gottfried played at Alabama under Wimp Sanderson from 1984-87, and was a part of three NCAA tournament Sweet 16 teams.Gottfried returned to Alabama as head coach in 1998, with his teams winning 210 games and playing in the NCAA tournament five straight seasons from 2002-06. His 2002 team won the SEC regular-season championship, while his 2004 squad reached the NCAA tournament Elite Eight.Gottfried resigned under pressure at Alabama midway through the 2008-09 season, his 11th with the Crimson Tide.

101,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — In the most controversial decision in Kentucky Derby history, 65-to-1 long shot Country House was named the winner of the race after Maximum Security, who went under the wire first, was disqualified by stewards. Though it’s the second time a winner has been disqualified in the race’s 145-year history, it’s the first time it’s happened because of a foul claim during the race. In 1968, Dancer’s Image was disqualified days after the race because of a drug violation.Maximum Security was taken down due to an incident coming around the turn when he veered out slightly, squeezing War of Will and causing Long Range Toddy to take back. Though jockey Luis Saez was able to straighten Maximum Security almost immediately coming off the turn, the racing stewards determined that the foul was egregious enough to take down a Derby winner — and a commanding one at that as Maximum Security had led every step.Bill Mott, the trainer of Country House, told NBC during the 15-minute review of the foul claim that he thought Maximum Security would be disqualified if it was a maiden race on a weekday, not the Kentucky Derby.WHAT'S AN OBJECTION?:Here's what happened with Country House and Maximum SecurityPAYOUTS:Here are the Kentucky Derby payouts after Country House's shocking victoryWORLD REACTS:Wild reactions after Country House wins Kentucky Derby“It's not supposed to matter -- Kentucky Derby or whatever it is,” Mott said. “There's a couple horses that nearly went down in the race and it eliminated all chance for them."" Code of Honor took second at 14-to-1, while Tacitus finished third at 5-to-1. By rule, Maximum Security was officially placed 17th behind Long Range Toddy.The $132.40 payout for a $2 win ticket for Country House is the second-highest in Derby history.           ",0.0

They hit 9 of 23 three-pointers in this one.They also scored 27 points off turnovers and stole the ball 12 times, including four from guard Jarrod West.“We like to take pride in our defense,” West said. “I know people don’t think of us that way.”After Elmore sank a three-pointer to tie the game at 65, four other Marshall players combined to hit six of their team’s final eight field-goal shots to win the game at Viejas Arena. Forward Ajdin Penava from Sarajevo got three of those buckets and finished with 16 points.“They made huge plays down the stretch, and without that we wouldn’t have won,” Elmore said. “Just a great win.”The loss stung for Wichita State, which previously had been on the other end of NCAA tournament upsets. This is the earliest the Shockers (25-8) have been eliminated from the tournament since 2012, the first of seven consecutive NCAA tournament appearances, which included a Final Four and Sweet 16.""It's a special feeling; I'm happy for them,"" Wichita State coach Gregg Marshall said. ""Obviously, not happy that we're on the losing end of this one.""Marshall's victory sends the Herd to a second-round game Sunday against Murray State or in-state foe West Virginia, which no longer plays the Herd during the regular season.West Virginia coach Bob Huggins watched some of the Marshall game Friday from courtside.D’Antoni battled away a question about that possible matchup after Friday’s win.“Hell, I am still celebrating this one,” he said. “You’re off on the other one?

""When the California (""Fair Pay to Play"") law came out, they responded by calling it an 'existential threat' to college sports, that it's going to ruin everything if athletes are paid,' and suggesting California could be annexed from the NCAA. Now, like they always do, they're reacting. They're reacting to different state and federal governments forcing action. They're trying to stall and say, 'Look at what we're doing.' Their abandonment of any form of principle is frankly embarrassing.""On the heels of California's bill being signed that effectively will allow college athletes in the state to profit off their name, image and likeness starting in 2023, NCAA's top decision-makers voted unanimously Tuesday to start the process of modifying its rule. It will allow college athletes to profit from their names, images and likenesses ""in a manner consistent with the collegiate model.""NCAA PROPOSAL:Delaying will go until government intervenesANOTHER ONE?:Why Virginia's basketball culture positions Cavaliers to rebuild after titleCOLLEGE FOOTBALL PICKS:Here's how our staff sees the games playing outBilas said the NCAA's response is bogus: ""The whole 'fit with the collegiate model' is a made-up term for not allowing anything relevant to happen. I don't see any significant movement towards players having actual rights here. What (the NCAA) really means is 'severely limited and regulated' (changes) with very little consequence and benefit to the players."" Bilas said the NCAA had plenty of opportunities to be proactive instead of reactive but instead failed to take initiative a long time ago. ""The NCAA is like the retailer surprised by Christmas coming on December 25,"" Bilas said. ""They're sitting here now saying, 'Oh my gosh why didn't you tell us the holiday season was coming.' They're in this position because of lack of foresight, lack of leadership and an unwillingness to address the multi-billion industry that they created. This has been coming for a long time. The state government just sped it all up, and they continue to talk in double speak and have further inaction. ""They've done this all to themselves. And now an organization that had very little credibility to start with basically has none remaining.""Bilas, a part-time lawyer and former Duke basketball player, has long been a proponent of student-athletes receiving compensation and criticized the NCAA's scholarship model that doesn't allow individuals to profit in the same way others in the country can.""The NCAA argued in the '80s that schools shouldn't be put on television, that it would destroy college sports,"" Bilas said. ""Not only did it not destroy anything, it turned it into a gigantic revenue stream. And some of that money has got to go to the players. They have all these contradictions that go to the point of hypocrisy by saying it will ruin women's or Olympic sports or there isn't enough money to go around. This is a multi-billion dollar industry. Most fair-minded people see through this.""Bilas was asked what he would do if he were in NCAA president Mark Emmert's position right now. ""What would I do if I were in charge?

107,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The New York Yankees keep on getting hurt — and winning.DJ LeMahieu and Gio Urshela became the latest Yankees to get hurt as New York completed a three-game sweep of the San Francisco Giants with an 11-5 win Sunday that included another long home run by Gary Sánchez.""I've always felt with this team, through ups and downs, they're really good at turning the page,"" Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. ""But there is an extra focus right now with what we're going through. Guys are coming in ready for any kind of role, any kind of situation, and they're delivering.""LeMahieu was removed in the bottom of the third because of right knee inflammation. LeMahieu fouled a pitch off the knee on Friday night and had the knee wrapped with ice after Friday's and Saturday's games. In his first season with the Yankees, LaMahieu is hitting .310 with 15 RBIs.Urshela left after he was hit on his left hand by an 88.5 mph cutter from Nick Vincent in the fifth. Urshela had two hits Sunday and is batting .351 with six RBIs in 57 at-bats.The Yankees said X-rays on both players were negative. LeMahieu is scheduled to undergo an MRI on Monday.""It's the story of the season, besides winning a bunch of games lately,"" LeMahieu said. ""It's frustrating.""New York has had 15 players on the injured list this year and just two have come back: Sánchez and pitcher CC Sabathia.

Happ as a pinch-hitter in the seventh inning, and he grounded out.""Just proud of how they've rallied around one another,"" Boone said. ""We've got really good makeup in that room. It's something that's important to us, to have those kind of people.

110,"Researchers put forth more evidence that playing tackle football before age 12 could lead to long-term consequences later in life, according to a study published Monday that could give more fuel to legislators looking to ban younger children from playing the sport.  The study, published in the Annals of Neurology, showed that, on average, those who played tackle football before age 12 had cognitive issues arise 13.39 years earlier, and behavioral and mood problems 13.28 years earlier than those who began to play at 12 or older. In addition, for every one year younger that someone was exposed to tackle football, the onset of cognitive problems occurred 2.4 years earlier and behavioral and mood problems 2.5 years earlier.“Youth exposure to repetitive head impacts in tackle football may reduce one’s resiliency to brain diseases later in life, including, but not limited to, CTE,” Ann McKee, director of Boston University’s CTE Center and one of the study’s authors, said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports. “It makes common sense that children, whose brains are rapidly developing, should not be hitting their heads hundreds of times per season.”Researchers from the VA Boston Healthcare System and Boston University School of Medicine led this latest study. The same researchers previously published findings on the link between playing tackle football at a young age and its implications on the brain, including the debilitating brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). MORE:Starting with Browns' Baker Mayfield, most intriguing story lines out of NFL draftMORE:NFL draft grades 2018: Which teams had best, worst classes?Legislators in Illinois, New York, California and other states have offered legislation that would ban tackle football before age 12. The bills, however, have gained little traction, and none are close to becoming law. The push comes as youth tackle football has seen a drop in participation as more research on concussions and other brain trauma has been released.  The study looked at the backgrounds of 246 deceased football players, including 211 who were diagnosed with CTE after their deaths. Of the 211 who had CTE, 64 were college players, seven were high school players, two were semi-pro players and 138 played pro football. Researchers conducted interviews with family and friends of the players to determine the onset of symptoms. “Younger age of first exposure to tackle football appears to increase vulnerability to the effects of CTE and other brain diseases or conditions,” Michael Alosco, an investigator at the BU Alzheimer’s Disease Center and the BU CTE Center, said in a statement. “That is, it influences when cognitive, behavioral, and mood symptoms begin. It is comparable to research showing that children exposed to neurotoxins (like lead) during critical periods of neurodevelopment can have earlier onset and more severe long-term neurological effects.”While the earlier a player started tackle football appears to lead to earlier onset of issues, researchers found it doesn’t affect the severity of CTE or other brain diseases. Follow Perez on Twitter @byajperez  ",0.0
111,"North Carolina State has stopped making buyout payments to former basketball coach Mark Gottfried, according to a report Tuesday by the Raleigh News & Observer.Gottfried — a former Alabama player and coach — was fired in 2017 by N.C. State, which is $520,000 behind on buyout payments, according to his attorney, who said the school is ""attempting to wriggle out of"" the terms of its agreement. Gottfried's name has recently surfaced in connection with the ongoing FBI investigation into college basketball.ESPN.com reported March 9 that Gottfried, who recently completed his first season at Cal State-Northridge, was implicated in court filings by the attorney of Orlando Early, his former assistant at both Alabama and N.C. State. Early’s attorney alleges that on one occasion Gottfried handed Early two envelopes that Early understood to contain cash, with instructions to deliver them to the trainer of Dennis Smith Jr., a star guard who was ACC Rookie of the Year for the Wolfpack in 2016-17 and who now plays for the New York Knicks.Gottfried, who has denied the allegations regarding Smith, coached six seasons at N.C.

He was coach at Alabama from 1998-2009, winning 210 games and playing in the NCAA tournament five straight seasons from 2002-06.Under terms of his buyout with N.C.

113,"Should you sell Verlander for a king's ransom? (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio)Owners who want to make aggressive moves on the pitching market will find a handful of options this week. Additionally, this is a great time for owners to make bold moves with some of the recently promoted prospects.Buy LowMaeda was trending in the right direction before landing on the disabled list with a thigh injury. And in short, I don’t believe there is much wrong with him. The Dodgers are famous for using the 10-day IL as a way of building in rest for their delicate hurlers, and this trip by Maeda could be for the slightest of ailments. Wise owners will try to pick him up cheap from a competitor who has little room to stash another injured player.Both situationally and overall, Rodriguez has been one of the unluckiest starters in baseball this season. The southpaw has controlled the strike zone (3.5 K:BB ratio) but a .364 BABIP and a 65.3 percent strand rate have resulted in a 4.89 ERA that varies greatly from his 2.97 FIP and 3.54 xFIP. He can likely be added for a minimal cost in all mixed leagues right now.Like Rodriguez, Wheeler has been burned by bad luck in multiple ways. His .355 BABIP is among the highest in baseball, and his 67.2 percent strand rate is also an artificially bad mark. While the right-hander could stand to improve his 8.6 percent walk rate, his 26.2 percent whiff rate is a stellar mark and he is among baseball’s best at limiting hard contact (28.9 percent). Wheeler’s 2.86 FIP paints a rosy picture of someone who should soon improve.[Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Football league for free today]Hicks has been quiet (.188/.278/.375 slash line) since returning from a season-opening IL stint on May 15. His slow start keeps the buy-low window open for someone who has massive potential (27 homers, 11 steals in 581 plate appearances in 2018) once he gets on track. Owners with room to acquire and stash Hicks right now could have an impact player once he gets rolling and is joined by superstar sluggers Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Judge.Story continuesThis is more of a deep-league tip, as Shaw can be dropped in the shallowest formats. The 29 year old has virtually zero fantasy buzz right now, batting just .163 with four homers before landing on the IL with a wrist injury. The subsequent promotion of prospect Keston Hiura has caused the fantasy world to write off Shaw, but there is a chance that Hiura could flop in his Major League debut. Having produced 63 homers across 2017-18, Shaw has the potential to turn his season around.Sell HighJustin Verlander, SP, AstrosThe top fantasy starter this season, Verlander is a little over his skis right now. His year-over-year BABIP has dropped more than 100 points to .171, and his 96.0 percent strand rate is far from a sustainable mark. The veteran remains a mixed-league ace, but his 3.86 FIP is a strong indicator that we will soon see significant movement on his 2.38 ERA. This could be a good time for owners to sell him for a king’s ransom.Christian Vazquez, C, Red SoxVazquez owners can certainly sell him on the trade market as an up-and-coming player who hits in a talented lineup and occupies the most coveted fantasy position. But the truth is that his batted-ball data is mostly unchanged from previous seasons and major jumps in luck (.337 BABIP, 17.6 percent HR/FB rate) have spurred on his recent success.Keston Hiura, 2B, BrewersHiura is mostly here as a placeholder for all the recently promoted prospects. Fantasy owners have a strong tendency to go bananas for hyped rookies, and the buzz is out of control after the likes of Hiura, Austin Riley and Brenden Rodgers were all added to Major League rosters in the span of a few days. Those who were fortunate enough to pluck one of these potential gems off the waiver wire may want to cash out now, as some of these future studs are going to have rocky beginnings.Joey Gallo, 1B/OF, RangersSome fantasy owners will see Gallo’s .277 average and believe that he has gone from power source to all-around stud. But he has made no improvements on his strikeout rate, and even though his batted-ball data has improved, he likely can’t sustain a .388 BABIP. Additionally, his 41.9 percent HR/FB rate will likely normalize in the coming weeks. Gallo is good, but he is perhaps not as good as his potential trade return.Michael Brantley, OF, AstrosAs a hitter, I love Brantley. But as a fantasy asset, he is likely due for some regression in the power department. The veteran owns a 17.9 percent HR/FB rate, which is much higher than his career mark and doesn’t reflect someone with little change in batted-ball data who relocated in the offseason to a tough park for power hitters. Additionally, there are lingering injury concerns for a 32 year old who has logged more than his fair share of career DL stints.Listen to the Yahoo Fantasy Baseball Podcast",0.0

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.comIndianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck announced his retirement from the NFL Saturday night, bringing an abrupt and shocking end to his once-promising career.""I am going to retire,"" Luck told reporters following the Colts' 27-17 preseason loss to the Chicago Bears. ""This is not an easy decision. It's the hardest decision of my life. But it is the right decision for me.""ESPN reported that Luck, who turns 30 next month, had informed Colts owner Jim Irsay of his decision and would make his formal retirement announcement at a press conference Sunday. But the news broke during the fourth quarter of the Colts-Bears game, prompting a buzz in the crowd at Indianapolis' Lucas Oil Stadium.Luck was seen in street clothes on the sideline and addressed reporters after the game.Earlier this month, Colts general manager Chris Ballard announced that Luck would miss the entire preseason due to lingering pain in his lower left leg. Ballard said tests showed that Luck appeared to be suffering from an injury near the front of his ankle, something his previously diagnosed strained left calf might have exacerbated.“Honestly, I think it’s a cumulative thing through the years. Andrew’s had some issues with his left [a]nkle] for a while, so I think it’s really a cumulative thing,” Ballard told local reporters on a conference call Aug. 13. “We think we’ve found it. You hope you’ve found what the cause is. Is there a 100 percent guarantee? No, but we think we have, so we’ll move forward and try to treat it.”

      Ballard and coach Frank Reich initially described the injury as a strained calf, but when Luck continued to complain about soreness, team officials started digging deeper to get answers. On Aug. 12, Irsay told SiriusXM radio the team believed Luck had an injury to the os trigonum, a small, accessory bone near the back of the ankle. But the following day, Ballard said new tests determined the soreness was coming from the front of the ankle.The injury had kept Luck out of all of the team’s offseason workouts and all but three training camp practices, and put Luck's status for the Colts' Sept. 8 season opener against the Los Angeles Chargers in doubt. In a recent interview, Luck said he felt as if something was tugging at his lower left leg near the ankle when he ran.NFL LEGEND JOHN ELWAY OPENS UP ABOUT DEBILITATING CONDITION: 'I COULDN'T PICK UP A FOOTBALL'Drafted with the first overall pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, Luck quickly established himself as one of the best young quarterbacks in the league. In 2014, he threw for 4,761 yards and 40 touchdowns in leading the Colts to an 11-5 record and a berth in the AFC Championship Game.

120,"Michelle R. MartinelliFor the first time in forever, Nathan Adrian truly has no idea if he'll have a strong swim Friday. And at this point, it doesn't really matter to the five-time Olympic gold medalist. He's simply elated to be back.Adrian, a 30-year-old three-time Olympian, was recently diagnosed with testicular cancer. He had two surgeries - one in December to remove the tumor and one in late January to remove some lymph nodes - which forced him to pause his swimming career for the longest time since he was 4, he explained. But this weekend at the TYR Pro Swim Series in Bloomington, Indiana, he's making his return to the pool and is nervously excited about it.""Win, lose, first, last - I just want to get back in my rhythm, back in my routine,"" Adrian told For The Win. ""That's what I strive for, what I wish I had through the entire treatment process. … Now I'm finally here, and I have no idea whether or not I'm going to swim fast. But the fact is I actually get to compete, and I'm happy.""He'll race in the 100-meter freestyle Friday and the 50-meter free Sunday. He won Olympic gold in the 100 at the 2012 London Games and bronze in both events in Rio in 2016.Adrian said he started physical therapy immediately after his second surgery. Not allowed to carry more than 15 pounds for weeks after his procedure, he was doing things like lifting a can of soup over his head. At 6-foot-6, he also estimated he lost 10 to 15 pounds, dropping down to about 215 before eventually gaining it all back.But enduring the immediate recovery after his surgeries - which included ""five holes cut in my abdomen"" - was only a tiny part of his journey.Physically, the left side of his body - and not just where incisions were made - is lagging behind his right side. After his surgeries, he overcompensated by relying on his right arm, right leg and right-side muscles. So he's been reteaching his left everything how to engage, which ranges from work in the weight room to brushing his teeth while balancing on his left foot.""[It's] super random stuff like my left leg is not as explosive right now as it normally is,"" Adrian said. ""I don't sweat out of my left foot. That's super random and super weird.""He laughed at the idea that he has his pre-surgery power off the blocks, or that his strength with each stroke is back. But he's progressing and is obviously in good enough shape to compete.""This is a journey that's going to last much much longer than four or five months,"" he said. ""I wish I was superhuman like that - like Wolverine and be able to recover that quickly.""Longterm, he added that he expects to ""deal with these bilateral asymmetries probably somewhat for the rest of my life."" But for all the physical challenges he faces, the mental side of a cancer diagnosis, treatment and recovery, especially for a professional athlete, is particularly daunting.Without his years-long routine of swimming and training for up to eight hours a day - and occasionally more - Adrian said he needed to keep himself busy in a sometimes futile effort to feel normal again.""Otherwise, I'd sit there and feel bad for myself, and I'd watch Netflix all day,"" he said.Still, the same questions that flooded his mind when he was first diagnosed resurface when he has down time. Will he still be able to qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics? Will he ever compete at the same level he once did? Doctors caught the cancer early, but what if he falls into the tiny percent of incurable testicular cancer patients? What if he still needs chemo? When part of his body hurts, is that another tumor?""For as much as I was taking care of it, part of me felt betrayed by my own body,"" Adrian said. ""But it was kind of a freak accident, so you have to forgive yourself.""""I still have to listen to podcasts to go to sleep these days because if not, my head starts to spin and you start thinking crazy thoughts,"" he continued. ""There were times of waking up and just bursting into tears. I don't speak about that a ton because I don't particularly like reliving it, but it doesn't mean it wasn't there. It doesn't mean you're not worried about your own life and safety.""Along with support from his wife, Hallie, and his mom, Cecilia, Adrian had help from his teammates - he trains at UC Berkeley, where he also went to college - and other athletes. He said Lance Armstrong and Olympic swimmer Eric Shanteau, who both had testicular cancer, reached out. Katie Ledecky sent a handwritten card.Without needing chemotherapy, there is no current evidence that Adrian still has cancer. But he said he's on active surveillance protocol for the next few years, which includes an MRI every three months and blood tests every two months.He said he was dealt a ""pretty intense dose"" of perspective on life, realizing that his goal of competing in a fourth Olympics could still be ripped away from him with one visit to his doctors.Adrian expects to be emotional at some point this weekend, but he has no idea when. Maybe it's when he's behind the blocks for this first race since December, maybe it's right after he competes or when he has a moment to himself. With the help of his tunnel vision mentality from before his diagnosis, he's focused on his health with his eye on Tokyo next summer.""I'm not over it, but it's something I have accepted,"" he said. ""This isn't Rick and Morty. I can't use my portal gun and go to a different universe where I don't have cancer. It's really about doing what you can and controlling what you can.""",0.0

128,"Trade season has arrived, baseball fans. With the MLB All-Star game now in the past, it’s time for teams to decide whether they’re trade deadline buyers or sellers.The wheeling-and-dealing has already begun, as the Boston Red Sox acquired Drew Pomeranz in the first high-profile move before the Aug. 1 deadline. (Yes, MLB moved the deadline back by a day this year since July 31 fell on a Sunday).Trade season 2016 doesn’t look to be as much of blockbuster as the past two seasons. There’s no David Price or Jon Lester out there waiting to shake up entire divisions. But there are interesting players and interesting storylines.[Join a Yahoo Daily Fantasy Baseball contest now]The team we’re watching most is the New York Yankees, who have a few sell-able assets if they decide to punt on 2016, break up their bullpen and send veteran Carlos Beltran to yet another team. Beyond that, players like Ryan Braun, Carlos Gonzalez and Sonny Gray could be made available ahead of a weak free agent class, but that’s hardly a guarantee — and the price on each of them would be high.The real key to this year’s deadline might be in the players who are down a run on the ladder. The Jay Bruces and Julio Tehrans of the world, for instance, could make all the difference for a team eyeing an October run.With that, here are 15 of the most intriguing names to watch before baseball’s Aug. 1 trade deadline.Andrew Miller, New York Yankees Having one of best relievers in the game on a team that likely won’t make the playoffs is a waste of resources. Given his track record of dominance, New York Yankees reliever Andrew Miller could fetch a decent prospect or two in a trade if the Yankees decide they are sellers. Since 2012, Miller has a 2.22 ERA, ranks third with a 39.4 percent strikeout rate and is eighth in fWAR among relievers. He’s been dominant, should continue to be dominant, and is under contract through 2018 at $9 million per season. All those things make him the best reliever on the market. (Chris Cwik)Story continuesAroldis Chapman, Yankees If Miller is No. 1, then teammate Chapman is No. 2. And there’s a good chance we Chapman hitting triple digits on yet another team’s radar gun this month. While Miller is the better long-term option out of the Yankees’ bullpen, Chapman will come cheaper. He’s a tried-and-true rental, a free agent after this season. So any team needing bullpen help and willing to look past his baggage, might find a valuable piece of their bullpen. The Cubs, for instance, could be instantly improved by adding either Chapman or Miller. (Mike Oz) (Getty Images/Thearon W. Henderson)Ryan Braun, Milwaukee Brewers If a team needs offensive production, they don’t need to look further than Ryan Braun. He’s hitting over .300 and having his best season since 2012, even with the weak lineup the Brewers are putting around him. Plop him in a lineup with better hitters, and Braun could really shine. Even though health is always a concern with Braun, he’s managed to avoid the DL despite nagging injuries. Of course, the cost can’t be ignored. Braun is signed through at least 2020, with a mutual option for 2021, and the cost is between $17 million and $20 million a year. That’s not chump change. But it’s a small price to pay for a guy who has a .379 average in 15 postseason games. (Liz Roscher)Jay Bruce, Cincinnati Reds Somebody is about to land a motivated outfielder. After a couple rough offensive seasons, Bruce has been back in All-Star form this season connecting for 18 home runs ahead of the break. He’s also not known for his defense, but made one of the best plays over the weekend to take away a home run. He looks like a guy itching to play meaningful baseball and the team that land him should benefit greatly. (Mark Townsend)Carlos Gonzalez, Colorado Rockies Carlos Gonzalez isn’t going to be on the next Rockies winner and is owed a fair amount of money over the next year and a half. It makes all the sense in the world for the Rockies to deal him now. In 88 games, he’s hit .316/.365/.546, with 19 home runs. While he’s been injury-prone over his career, he’s been healthy this year and played in 153 games last season. The lefty is owed half of his $17 million salary this year, and will make $20 million next season. For the right contender, though, that might all be worth it. (Cwik)Julio Teheran, Atlanta Braves With his thigh injury behind him, the 2016 All-Star may be the most interesting starting pitcher on the market. At 25, Teheran still has youth on his side. He’s also affordable with $25.5M owed over the next three seasons and a $12M team option for 2020. That should put him on every contender’s radar, but it will be interesting to see which team comes up with the prospects that entice the Braves front office. (Townsend)(AP)Sonny Gray, Oakland Athletics The 26-year-old Gray might be in the middle of his worst season, but he still has value. The stats, including a 5.12 ERA and career-worst strikeout rate, aren’t exactly enticing, but consider Gray pitched through a neck injury earlier in the year. When healthy, he’s been one of the better, young pitchers around. On top of that, he’s under team control through 2019. The A’s don’t have to sell him now, but after seeing what Drew Pomeranz fetched back from Boston, they may want to at least entertain some offers. (Cwik)Andrew Cashner, San Diego Padres Cashner has had flashes of brilliance early in his career, but just couldn’t stay healthy. Now that he’s finally healthy, he’s having trouble putting up great stats. Over the past two seasons, Cashner has a 4.53 ERA over 252 1/3 innings. At 29, the hope that he turns into an ace might be gone, but maybe a change of scenery can get him back to his promising ways. He’s only under contract through the end of the year, and could improve his free-agent prospects if he pitches well with a new club. (Cwik)Jeremy Hellickson, Philadelphia Phillies This season has been an encouraging step forward for Hellickson. The 2011 Rookie of the Year has had a tough few seasons on the mound, but he’s been mostly solid for the Phillies, giving them some stability in a rotation that desperately needs it. Even though the Phils look better than they did a year ago, they certainly don’t need him for a postseason run, and they have yet another young pitcher waiting in the wings to take his place. Hellickson can provide a steady, if not spectacular arm in the back of a thin rotation, and there’s even a chance he could show more of the form that got him that Rookie of the Year award five years ago. (Roscher)Jonathan Lucroy, Brewers Impact catchers are so difficult to find that it’s not just contenders who have expressed interest in Lucroy. Teams like the Rangers, Mets and Astros have all been linked, but so have the Braves as they attempt to accelerate their turnaround before moving into their new stadium. With that interest in mind, it’s expected that the Brewers will let the market play out in attempt to get the most for their asset. Don’t be surprised if he’s still a Brewer until the final hours before the deadline. (Townsend)Melvin Upton Jr., Padres Who would have thought that we’d be talking about the erstwhile BJ Upton as a viable trade candidate? Upton’s having a pretty good season with the San Diego Padres, hitting .262 with 16 homers. He’s WAR is 2.3 this season, already surpassing last season and his two previous seasons in Atlanta, both of which saw him playing below replacement-level. But now, he’s reportedly attracting attention. He’s still owed some cash, mainly $16.4 million next season, but the right contender might see fit to gobble that up. (Oz)(AP)Carlos Beltran, Yankees Elder statesman Carlos Beltran is having his best season since 2013. His average is up 20 points over 2015, and he’s hit 19 homers in 86 games, which is the same number he hit in 133 games in 2015. Not bad for a 39-year-old. He’s in the last year of his contract with the Yankees, and would be a prime candidate for a team searching for a DH. As long as they can keep him there and avoid putting him in the field, Beltran’s got plenty left in the tank for a contender who needs a bat. (Roscher)Rich Hill, A’s The first couple months of 2016 had Hill looking like one of the top pitchers in the AL, and given the Oakland Athletics’ rep for wheeling-and-dealing, it wasn’t hard to imagine Hill, who is on a one-year deal, headed somewhere else by August. That’s been muddied some by injuries, as he first went to the DL with a groin injury and then left Sunday’s game after five pitches because of blisters on his pitching hand. Still, he’s been good enough this season (9-3 with a 2.25 ERA) that he should have plenty of suitors once he proves he’s healthy. (Oz)Matt Moore, Tampa Bay Rays He isn’t the same pitcher than the one who went 17-4 a few years ago, but the Rays should still be able to move Moore and get something good in return. The 27-year-old, when on, is very worth a rotation spot. He hasn’t thrived since coming back from Tommy John surgery last season, but the Rays shouldn’t have trouble finding someone who thinks Moore can bounce back from 4.33 first-half ERA. (Oz)Ervin Santana, Minnesota Twins The Twins fired by their long-time GM Terry Ryan on Monday, so we’ll see how that impact their trade-deadline moves. One of their players most likely to move, according to reports, is starter Ervin Santana, who is in the second season of a four-year deal in Minnesota. His overall numbers aren’t great this season — a 4.12 ERA with a 3-8 record — but he’s shown flashes. Last July 6, when he threw a two-hit shutout against the A’s. The Twins as a whole will be an interesting team to watch since they’re transitioning their front office at the same time the trade deadline approaches.

131,"A Texas family is facing charges after they fraudulently tried to obtain tickets to the Masters in Augusta.The family of four is charged with conspiracy and identity theft in a scheme, according to the U.S Attorney’s Office.The conspiracy was revealed Monday, via a press release, from the U.S. Attorney’s Office that charged Stephen Michael Freeman with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. His parents - Steven Lee Freeman and Diane Freeman - and his sister - Christine Oliverson - are charged with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.According to the U.S Attorney’s Office, the family bought a bulk mailing list and used names and addresses from that list to create fraudulent accounts in the Augusta National Golf Club’s online ticket application system.If those names were selected, Stephen Freeman would create fake identification to get the winner’s mailing address changed.From 2013 through 2017, the family used the stolen identities in an effort to cheat the lottery system that distributes tournament tickets and to circumvent Augusta National Golf Club’s rules allowing people to apply only once to enter its ticket lottery.“Once the defendants received the tickets at those addresses via U.S. Mail, they would then resell the tickets at a substantial profit,” the statement said, via WRDW.“The Masters is one of the world’s great sporting events, and tickets to the tournament are cherished by their fortunate recipients,” Southern District of Georgia U.S. Attorney Bobby L. Christine said. “Using fraud and deceit to circumvent the Augusta National’s generous lottery system is despicable, and those who follow the rules in hopes of winning tickets deserve better than to have their chances diminished by profiteering con artists.”“Because of the defendants’ greed, they now face substantial prison time if convicted of the alleged crimes,” Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta, said. “The FBI will always make it a priority to investigate anyone who tries to circumvent a fair process, whether it is the Masters or any other private or public entity.”The family ''could then resell the tickets at a substantial profit,'' the charging document said.The charges carry potential penalties of up to 20 years in prison, as well as substantial fines.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0

134,"NEW YORK — Amid one of the worst on-court seasons in recent school history, Arizona basketball had two significant victories this year. The first was that the Wildcats, despite the specter of coach Sean Miller’s involvement with the federal basketball investigation, somehow managed to land the nation’s No. 4 recruiting class. The second was a judge’s ruling that allowed Miller to avoid testifying in federal court, which helped he and Arizona avoid the awkward optics of a sitting head coach appearing at a federal bribery trial.But in the span of seven FBI wiretaps played in federal court on Wednesday morning, both of those victories appear in imminent danger. Sean Miller ended up having his starring day in court, he just didn’t have to show up. Amid a flurry of information in what could be remembered as one the most significant days of college basketball’s corruption cases, Arizona administrators likely find themselves at a self-induced awkward crossroads about Miller’s future.The wiretap testimony alleged that Miller was paying two Arizona players out of his own pocket — future No. 1 pick Deandre Ayton and former guard Rawle Alkins — which would amount to NCAA violations of the most serious nature.Former Arizona associate head coach Emanuel “Book” Richardson said to agent-runner Christian Dawkins that Miller was paying Ayton $10,000 per month, using the word “bought” to describe the transaction. Dawkins said: “He’s putting up some real money for them [racial slur]. He told me he’s getting killed.”That was soon followed by a casual acknowledgement by Dawkins that Miller was paying Alkins as well, basically saying that Miller’s payment helped Dawkins’ business expenses: “You already know, Sean’s taking care of Rawle and them,” Dawkins said. “So it ain’t no expense to Rawle. So that’s easy.”Sean Miller, kneeling, has been accused of paying players directly. (AP)To most around college athletics, the decision on what to do with Miller’s future should be easy. There have been two days of wiretap testimony here painting Miller’s program on the forefront of the market of paying players, as Tuesday brought allegations that Miller “fronted” the deal for Ayton. Dawkins also claimed on a wiretap played last week that Miller told him: “I’m taking care of everything myself. I want to bring you in.”Story continuesArizona finds itself in this conundrum over Miller’s future because their quest for a Final Four bid meant doubling down on Miller’s potential innocence. Seemingly, at this point, the only collegiate Board of Regents who could look at all this evidence and think Miller’s dramatic denial about paying players had a seed of truth would be one that consists of the Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy and Santa Claus.But this is Arizona, which channeled the spirit of Jerry Tarkanian-era UNLV and ignored obvious warning signs in the wake of an explosive — though flawed — ESPN report last year to cash in on the presence of Ayton and one of the program’s more talented teams this generation. Consider Wednesday’s testimony the piercing migraine of regret for risking the university’s reputation for a short-term March run instead of facing long-term realities. Arizona basically brought its institutional reputation to the blackjack table instead of investing in a 401K, and Wednesday will be remembered as the day school officials staggered back drunk and broke at sunrise.Since coming out in support of Miller late last season, the school has publicly handled the situation with the equivalent of administrators holding their hands over their ears to block out the noise. School officials persistently ignore requests for comment and have essentially dared the NCAA to come and find information that their coach was in control of the program.As the allegations have piled up and recruits have rolled in, Arizona has dueled with LSU as the country’s most outlandish bandit basketball program, the one that ADs whisper about on the phone and prompts coaches to wonder why there’s never any consequences.The University of Arizona issued a statement late Wednesday, saying that it “takes the information presented in court today very seriously and remains committed to the highest standards of integrity and ethical conduct which includes competing within the rules of the NCAA and the PAC-12 Conference.”Miller has had his associate head coach, Richardson, arrested by the FBI and plead guilty to a felony. That’s a sentence that would have been jarring two years ago but has been normalized in this environment. They’ve had another assistant, Mark Phelps, slated to be let go in an academic scandal. The Arizona board has discussed Miller’s future a handful of times in closed session and reportedly spent more than a $1 million in lawyer fees investigating on their own. (There were observers in court here the past two days on behalf of Arizona, furiously scribbling notes and likely leaving with writer’s cramp.)Arizona head coach Sean Miller is accused on an FBI wiretap of paying Deandre Ayton. (Getty Images)To folks in and around Tucson, the past two days have felt like a tipping point. One source with deep ties to the university told Yahoo Sports on Wednesday night: “Coach Miller has got to either walk to the center of this stage and start speaking clearly, or get off it altogether. An innocent man would have a forceful and convincing response.”Miller hasn’t said a whole lot about the case since his denial in the wake of the ESPN report last season.“I have never knowingly violated NCAA rules while serving as head coach of this great program,” he said in a statement. “I have never paid a recruit or prospect or their family or representative to come to Arizona. I never have and I never will. I have never arranged or directed payment or any improper benefits to a recruit or a prospect or their family or representative, and I never will.”Miller has long since lawyered up, circled the wagons and, wisely, managed to last 15 more months and make about $4 million more dollars. If Arizona and Miller do part ways, it’s unlikely that Miller could clear that kind of revenue soon. He’s a fine coach, but not one who the NBA will be pining for, which means he’ll need a rehab NBA apprenticeship similar to what Kelvin Sampson went through after he was exiled from Indiana.Credit Miller and his legal team for being crafty enough to navigate this far, as their strategy has been pragmatic and successful. But few outside Miller’s camp and Twitter truthers really thought he could keeping carry on like nothing happened, as this trail loomed with too many potential liabilities.Don’t discount more issues coming Miller’s way on Thursday, with Dawkins on the stand for what is likely the entire day. He’ll finish getting questions from Mark Moore, Merl Code’s attorney, in the morning before what will likely be a blistering cross-examination from the government.When you double-down on an untenable coaching situation to keep your coach for an NCAA tournament run, this type of crossfire becomes institutional karmic payback. That began when No. 13 Buffalo ran No. 4 Arizona off the court, continued through a listless season and was given an exclamation point today.Without having to show up, Sean Miller managed to have his day in court on Wednesday. It didn’t go well, and the thorny questions Arizona punted down the road 15 months ago are staring them back in the face again. The noise is mounting for Arizona regarding Sean Miller’s future, and the question remains how long they’ll end up keeping their hands over their ears wishing their problems away.More from Yahoo Sports:",0.0

137,"The Kyler Murray era kicked off Thursday night and the only slip up on the Arizona Cardinals rookie quarterback’s part was when he actually slipped on third and 9 and it had to go down as a sack.Chargers defensive end Anthony Lanier II was credited with the takedown, but only because he was the closest defender to Murray when he slipped and fell to the ground. It would end up being his last play of the game, but Murray didn’t disappoint during the Cardinals’ preseason opener at State Farm Stadium.The coveted first overall pick in this year’s draft, Murray said coming in that he simply wanted to have a good showing, get a feel for things, and then watch the rest of the game with his teammates from the sideline.Asked what would make him feel good: ""Complete a couple balls, maybe score a touchdown or something.""Murray didn’t get the touchdown, but he completed each of his first six pass attempts for 44 yards and a 92.9 quarterback rating and he looked completely calm and in total command running Arizona’s first-team offense.There was some confusion, however, regarding his final pass, in which he scrambled away from the clutches of linebacker Chris Peace and hit fellow rookie KeeSean Johnson down the right sideline for a 7-yard gain.Only it wasn’t a gain because referees ruled Johnson had stepped out of bounds and came back onto the field of play before making the catch.In addition to an automatic loss of down, Murray was charged with an incompletion. Game operations staff checked in with NFL headquarters in New York to decipher the conclusion and reporters were told the decision came straight out of the rule book.""I thought it was smooth,"" Murray said at halftime. ""I was anxious to get out there, move around and throw it a little bit. I really just tried to execute whatever coach called and I think we did that for the most part.""Murray and the Cardinals' offense, which was missing two starters in left guard Justin Pugh (shoulder) and receiver Tim White, who was out with an unspecified injury, started things out with the ball at their own 2-yard line following a Chargers’ turnover.NFL PRESEASON:Browns rookie who talked his way into tryout scores TDDAZZLING DEBUT:Giants rookie QB was lights out4th & MONDAY:Our NFL newsletter always brings the blitzAfter a 1-yard dive up the middle by David Johnson, Murray completed a pair of quick, sharp passes to Damiere Byrd and Trent Sherfield for six and eight yards, respectively.""When we got the strip, I was like, 'Good,' "" Murray said. ""At the same time I was like 'Of course, I get the ball at the two.' I wanted to go score, so my only mindset was go score. We brought it out and unfortunately didn’t finish the job.""Later, there was a play-action fake and another 8-yard completion to Sherfield, followed by the biggest offensive output, a short screen pass to Johnson for a 14-yard pick up.Murray then fired a quick out to Byrd for seven more yards and hit Fitzgerald for a 1-yard gain on a run-pass option.Next came the ""incompletion"" to Johnson and the ""sack"" by Lanier. Add it all up, and Murray did enough in his one and only series to satisfy first-year head coach Kliff Kingsbury.Kingsbury couldn’t be as pleased with his first-team defense, which was gashed for 58 yards on seven plays by a Chargers team playing without start quarterback Philip Rivers and hold-out running back Melvin Gordon.Backup quarterback Tyrod Taylor drove L.A. down to the Arizona 2 until Cardinals linebacker Jordan Hicks jarred the ball loose from running back Austin Ekeler and recovered the fumble himself.A handful of other Cardinals made some plays that stood out, from linebacker Dennis Gardeck to tight end Ricky Seals Jones and Sherfield, but everyone’s eyes were on QB1 — Murray.He’s been impressing every day since rookie minicamp back in May. As soon as the veterans began to report, it was clear they had full trust and confidence in the rookie.Fitzgerald said Murray knew the offense better than anyone and he was right.Though he didn’t get to showcase all of his talents and command on Thursday — and Kingsbury didn’t bother to open his bag of tricks as far as play calling — there’s already a lot to like and marvel about Murray.Running back Chase Edmonds said his favorite Murray moment came the other day during the team’s first outdoor practice.""It was hot as hell,"" Edmonds recalled. ""It was a crossing route and Fitz was between left guard and left tackle. Kyler zipped it sidearm before the window was even there. I’m looking at that play and I’m not making this comparison, but I’m like, 'That's a Patty Mahomes throw.' You see those highlights of Patty Mahomes bending his arm sideways and making a window where there’s not a window. It was just a beautiful throw.""There isn't one Murray highlight that stands out particularly above the rest for Kingsbury. For him, it’s been the entire process.""Yeah, I think just overall I’ve been proud of the way he’s handled things,"" the coach said. ""To be kind of pushed in as kind of the guy, there's no kind of grace period or like leading him in with any veteran presence at that position. He's remained humble, he's remained diligent in his work ethic, and really handled his business. So, I've been proud of that for him.""For Murray, his debut was everything he thought it might be.""It felt good,"" he said. ""Its really crazy.

And I think it was, in a lot of areas. “But to put yourself in the situation that he put himself in, whether it happened or not, if it happened, it’s so easy, but if it didn’t, that still was too bad of a decision to make us comfortable with keeping that person in our organization.""Foster, 24, was the 49ers' second-leading tackler in his rookie season in 2017 after being the No. 31 overall draft pick out of Alabama.The Redskins have seven other former Crimson Tide players, including five on their active roster (two are on injured reserve).Follow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz. ",0.0

In the past eight seasons, we have won a number of games and have made appearances in both the NIT and the NCAA Tournaments. However, in my evaluation, we have not sustained a consistent level of success against the most competitive teams in the nation to enable us to compete for SEC and NCAA Championships on an annual basis. That will continue to be the benchmark for our success throughout our athletic program.“During his tenure with our program, Mike Anderson has represented the University of Arkansas in a first-class manner and with the highest level of integrity on and off the floor. We are grateful for Coach Anderson’s many contributions to our program and most of all for his investment in the lives of the many student-athletes he has coached. He has been a positive influence on their lives, encouraged them and supported them on, both their individual and collective, academic and athletic journeys.

142,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Clemson's athletic department reported 15 violations to the NCAA in the past year, including three by the defending Atlantic Coast Conference football champions.The school released its infractions report Tuesday after an open records request by The Associated Press.None of the violations is considered serious. All but one of them is classified as a Level III infraction. Level III infractions are those the NCAA considers isolated or limited in nature; provide no more than a minimal recruiting, competitive or other advantage; and don't include more than a minimal impermissible benefit.2016 college football TV scheduleClemson detailed its NCAA violations from Aug. 1, 2015, through this past July 31.Three of the violations involved the football program, which starts the season ranked No. 2.One came from an ""accidental"" FaceTime call placed by coach Dabo Swinney to a prospect before the allowable date of Sept. 1. Coaches can't place any phone calls to the prospect from Sept. 1-15 as punishment for the infraction.Another violation in football came last October and involved two players who dropped engineering courses and were not enrolled full-time, as required by the NCAA. Clemson declared both players ineligible, conducted rules education with all athletes and paid a $500 fine. The NCAA restored the two athletes' eligibility.The final football infraction came this past January when the staff gave excess travel reimbursement to several prospects after their official visits. The school said the staff wrongly thought it could round up the travel reimbursement amount to the nearest dollar.The staffer involved received a letter of admonishment, although the school said it did not try to collect the overpay from prospects because of the ""minimal amount of the over-award.""The first-year baseball program of coach Monte Lee had three violations.College football 2016: Atlantic Coast Conference previewLee, who led the Tigers to the ACC Tournament title last May, was admonished for an infraction from last September when he responded to a text from a 2018 prospect before Sept. 1 of the player's junior year of high school.

When informed otherwise by the player, Lee stopped all communication with the prospect and reported it to the compliance office.Lee and his staff must also refrain from communicating with the player for two weeks starting Sept. 1.Last August, an assistant coach on Clemson's men's golf team impermissibly brought in an outside consultant to work with two players on the course and teach a three-session with the whole team.

During the feature, a Bills player is asked 20 questions, which usually concern lighter topics such as favorite foods and movies.McCarron got a few questions tailored for him, including asking for his best Saban story or saying. That's when he launched his impersonation -- as his 2-year-old son, Tripp, wandered through the shot and took a look at what his dad was doing.
McCarron also was asked where his three BCS national-championship rings were from Alabama's titles for the 2009, 2011 and 2012 seasons. McCarron said he'd given them to his grandfather, father and uncle.Here's the entire feature:After McCarron earned All-State honors in football and baseball at St. Paul's in Mobile and helped the Saints win the AHSAA Class 5A football championship in 2007, he was the starting quarterback for the Alabama teams that won the BCS national championships for the 2011 and 2012 seasons.

145,"There will be a new head football coach at Murphy High next season.Principal Joe Toomey told AL.com that former LSU standout Muskingum Barnes has been relieved of his coaching duties.Barnes was just 6-14 in two years as the head coach. His team finished its second consecutive 3-7 season on Friday night with a victory over winless Alma Bryant.“I just felt like after the body of work for the last two years that we needed to move on,” Toomey said. “It didn’t seem like our team was making the needed improvement. Our attendance is down, and our kids don’t seem to have the spirit they’ve had in the past. I felt like now was the time for a change.”Toomey actually notified Barnes of his decision Oct. 19 prior to the team’s game with Baker.“Out of respect for coach Barnes, I informed him three and a half weeks ahead of time,” Toomey said. “I didn’t want him to be blindsided, and I wanted him to be able to go out on his own terms. We talked, and it was a good conversation and we are both looking forward to the year to come.”Toomey said he would like to keep Barnes at the school in an administrative role if possible.“We are moving forward together,” he said.Barnes was promoted from assistant to head coach when Rick Cauley left following the 2016 season. Murphy has missed the playoffs each of the last two years and hasn’t won a playoff game since 2011.The Panthers, once one of the state’s premier teams, have made it out of the second round just one time since 1995. Still, Toomey said the history and tradition of the school should make the vacancy intriguing for many coaches.“I think there will be a lot of interest,” he said. “I feel like we will be able to pull a major candidate from somewhere whether it will be a retired Mississippi person or someone in Alabama looking to come to a school with great tradition.“I’ll have a few slots that person can use to hire some of their own coaches. We also have some great coaches that will probably stay as well. I feel like we can get an established head coach, but I’m not going to say they have to be established because I would hate to miss the next great up-and-coming assistant coach.”Toomey said he would like to have someone hired before the Christmas break, though it could be later than that if the top candidate’s team is involved in a deep playoff run.Murphy could be the fourth opening among Mobile County Public Schools this offseason. Baker, Davidson and Citronelle all have interim coaches at the moment. What will it take to turn the Panthers into a contender again?“It is going to take changing the culture and getting a few more kids out,” he said. “There are some athletes here that haven’t been interested for whatever reason. Our numbers are down. We really only have about 1,500 students.“But it’s a school with a great tradition, and I do feel like our talent pool is good enough. We just have to be more organized and prepared. I look at the good job coach (Tim) Carter is doing at Fairhope. It’s hard to believe they have better athletes then we do, but they are very well coached, and they are always in the right place.”",0.0

148,"COLLEGE PARK, Md. — In an attempt to boost student turnout at football games this season, the University of Maryland paid a total of $28,000 in scholarship money to students for attending games and staying until the fourth quarter.For several seasons, the Terrapins have struggled to fill the student section at Maryland Stadium, ranking third-worst in attendance among Big Ten teams last fall. The stadium is often invaded by larger opposing fan bases, and the student section has been known to thin out quickly and easily, regardless of the game outcome.“I mean, Maryland attendance could be a little better, you see all the Ohio State fans here?” said Maryland freshman and scholarship giveaway winner Jesse Akiva Klineman at last Saturday’s 52-51 home loss to the Buckeyes.“I’d love to have more Maryland fans here every week.”More:Question of the Week: What is college football's best rivalry?More:USA TODAY Sports college football staff picks for Week 13The attendance issues drew the attention of one motivated donor prior to the 2018 season. The donor, whose identity remains anonymous, approached the school with an idea to incentivize students to not only attend games but also stay at them.As a result of the donor’s funding, one Maryland student was randomly selected to win a scholarship of at least $5,000 in the fourth quarter of every home game this season. The catch: He or she had to enter the stadium prior to kickoff and stay until the fourth quarter to be eligible for the prize.If the student didn’t show, two backup names would be called for their chance at the scholarship. If the giveaway went unclaimed, the $5,000 would roll over until the next week, giving students a chance at a $10,000 scholarship.“Some students were kind of in shock that we were doing it, and I guess kind of in awe, [thinking] ‘Oh, all I have to do is show up at the start of the game and stay there until the fourth quarter and I might win $10,000?’” said Director of Marketing and Fan Experience Jordan Looby.Another donor, inspired by the original giveaway idea, offered to give a $1,000 scholarship in the third quarter of every home game, starting with the Terrapins’ Sept. 22 home date with Minnesota.Between the two giveaways, students could have hauled in $35,000 in scholarship money at the Terrapins’ six home games this year.Despite the added incentive for student support, the $5,000 scholarship went unclaimed at half of the school’s home games, while the $1,000 one went unclaimed twice.Nevertheless, Looby called the promotion a success.“If you’re just talking anecdotal evidence, I think it was successful... It’s not super often that we hear a ton of buzz about a specific promotion that we do,” he explained.“If we keep doing things like this and playing games like we did on Saturday [against Ohio State], that culture will start to build back up a little bit.”As for whether the promotion will continue, that decision will be left up to the donors. ""I don't think it would be something that's necessarily budgeted for us internally,"" Looby said. ""I'd love to do it again, but I think it would require probably some support like it did this year.""     ",0.0

After running ahead for 3 yards, Parker flipped the ball to Drake, who immediately slipped a tackle and picked his way through New England defenders the final 52 yards to the end zone.
Drake had been helped off the field earlier in the game, but he had enough to run past Rob Gronkowski as the final defender. The Patriots had their big tight end on the field to guard against the expected Hail Mary.""To tell you the truth, I just kind of blacked out,"" Drake said in explaining how he negotiated the minefield of Patriots to score.
The long run gave Drake a strange stat line. The running back finished the contest with one reception and 55 receiving yards. His one catch in the game had resulted in a 3-yard gain. Drake got 52 receiving yards on the touchdown play without catching a pass.Drake also had six rushing attempts for 24 yards against New England.FOR MORE OF AL.COM’S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGE

152,"Auburn has 32 million reasons to keep Gus Malzahn as head coach, but as more time passes, it seems like money is less and less of a consideration.Less than a year after he signed a 7-year, $49 million contract extension, the Malzahn era at Auburn might be unraveling before our very eyes. Blowout losses to Georgia and Alabama — part of a 7-5 season that already included stunning defeats against Mississippi State and Tennessee — have apparently turned up the heat to such a degree that it seems like a real possibility we’ve seen the last of Malzahn on the Auburn sideline.Even if he’s not outright fired, there are rumblings that Auburn powerbrokers are trying to make things so unpleasant for Malzahn — doing things such as trying to restrict his ability to hire and fire assistants and dragging their feet on fundraising for a new football building — that he’ll quit on his own and negotiate some sort of reduced buyout to go away. There’s precedent for that with former Florida coach Jim McElwain, who reached a settlement with the school and resigned late in the 2017 season. In McElwain’s case, however, there were extenuating circumstances. McElwain had made debunked — or at least wildly exaggerated — claims of death threats to him and his family, which the school allegedly used to make him think they could or would fire him for cause (i.e., no buyout). There appears to be no such dirt on Malzahn — other than not winning enough football games. It’s been reported that Auburn is ready to move on from Malzahn — buyout be damned — and will try to lure the biggest coaching free agent in America, retired former Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops.On Monday, Stoops emphatically denied he’d been contacted by Auburn, telling USA Today Sports, “It’s just foolish speculation that just is thrown out there that has no basis to it.” But take that with a grain of salt.While it would seem like Stoops would have no reason to lie given that he’s currently unemployed, that would only be true if the Auburn job was open. Coaches are a fraternity, and it’s simple professional courtesy for one coach to not discuss or openly covet a job held by one of his brethren.I don’t have any proof Auburn had talks with Stoops, but people whose reporting I trust appear to. I believe a conversation took place, and I tend to lean toward Stoops having said he wasn’t interested.And that’s the biggest question in all this: If Auburn chooses to move on from Malzahn and pays the money it would take to do so (whether that’s $32 million, or a reduced settlement), who would they be able to hire? In-state up-and-comers like UAB’s Bill Clark and Troy’s Neal Brown are proven winners who would probably jump at the opportunity, but are those big enough names to satisfy the Auburn fan base?Brown is a disciple of Washington State “Air Raid” guru Mike Leach, as are Syracuse’s Dino Babers and West Virginia’s Dana Holgorsen. Both Babers and Holgorsen have lifted previously moribund programs into the Top 15 of the national rankings this season. Could Babers or Holgorsen be lured to Auburn? Probably. Would either win big with the Tigers? Hard to say.What about bigger names? Chris Petersen isn’t leaving Washington for Auburn. Period.Penn State’s James Franklin is a high-energy guy and a great recruiter, but he’s had the same problems consistently beating Ohio State and Michigan — he’s 2-8 against the Buckeyes and Wolverines — that Malzahn has had with Alabama and Georgia.Leach probably would take the job, but he comes with his own set of headaches Auburn administrators probably wouldn’t be interested in.Or Auburn could stand pat with Malzahn, let him hire a new offensive coordinator (Hugh Freeze or recently fired Kliff Kingsbury maybe?) and hope things get better in 2019. But is there reason to believe that will happen?Auburn returns much of its offensive talent, including some promising freshmen. But there’s still an unsettled situation at quarterback, even if former Clemson starter Kelly Bryant signs on as a graduate transfer (Jarrett Stidham is all but gone, most observers believe). On defense, the Tigers lose four seniors — all three linebackers and the nose tackle — from a unit that has carried the team at times the last three years. And it’s likely underclassman such as linemen Derrick Brown and Marlon Davidson will test the NFL waters this spring.The schedule does flip back to both Georgia and Alabama visiting Auburn next year, but there’s a solid chance both of those teams will be even better in 2019 than they were in 2018. Can we say the same for Auburn?It would be unfair not to point out many of the good things Malzahn has done in his six years at Auburn. He’s won the SEC West twice, came within one defensive stop of a national championship and he’s the only active head coach in the conference with even one win over Nick Saban (he’s got two).But it’s also fair to ask if Malzahn can capture the magic of 2013 or 2017 again in the near future. Winning cures a lot of things, but Malzahn seems to have lost the Auburn fanbase.The way things have fallen apart, the question you might have to ask yourself if you’re an Auburn fan is not “can we afford to fire Gus Malzahn?” but “can we afford not to?”What do you think? I’ll take your questions and comments on that or anything else on your mind beginning at 10 a.m.",0.0
153,"The TelegraphTwo of the surprise packages of this clay-court season have been British – initially Dan Evans, who made a deep run in Monte Carlo, and more lately Cameron Norrie, who played his second final in three weeks on Sunday. Unfortunately, Norrie wasn’t able to land a maiden ATP title in Lyon. But then he was up against Stefanos Tsitsipas, who has been the dominant force of 2021 outside the slams, and now stands at No 1 in the table of most rankings points gained since January 1. Nevertheless, it had been a hugely creditable effort for Norrie to go this far, especially when you consider that he took out top seed Dominic Thiem on Thursday, and then trounced big-hitting Russian Karen Khachanov in Saturday’s semi-final, losing only two games in the process. Norrie has come to clay late in his career, but it feels like this is developing into his favourite surface. He has one of the heaviest left-handed forehands in the game, loaded with top-spin, and uses it like a miniature version of Rafael Nadal. The result has been a tally of 14 wins and only four losses since he began his European clay-court swing in Barcelona. So while the French Open, which starts next Sunday, has traditionally been a graveyard of British hopes, there are reasons to hope that this year’s event could deliver some more positive results. Norrie’s previous final in Estoril had been a nervewracking affair which he eventually lost on a deciding-set tie-break to the more experienced Spaniard Albert Ramos-Vinolas. Sunday was more straightforward for Tsitsipas, who needed only 69 minutes to hammer home a 6-3, 6-3 victory. It was Tsitsipas’ second title of the clay-court sequence, after he won Monte Carlo in mid-April, taking out Evans in the semi-final along the way. He has become a serious contender to upset the establishment – specifically Nadal and Novak Djokovic – at Roland Garros over the next few weeks. “I felt in good shape from the beginning of the tournament,” said Tsitsipas afterwards. “I am proud of today’s match, I knew it would be a difficult one against Cameron, who has been showing great tennis this week. He has been winning against good players and showing what the left hand can do on clay. “It was not an easy match today. I had to handle the nerves and I am proud of my performance and the way I stayed focused towards my goal.” On this year’s results, meanwhile, both Evans and Norrie stand among the world’s 20 most successful men. Evans is at No 16 and Norrie No 14. The next challenge for them both is to convert that ATP Tour form into a deep run at a major.",0.0

Akron went 4-8 in 2018.“A thorough assessment of the program yielded the decision,” Akron athletics director Larry Williams said. “We need new leadership to take this program to another level.”Said Bowden, “I’ve been told that I would not be retained at The University of Akron. It saddens me that I will not be able to work through this with my coaches and players. But the University feels it is time to bring in new leadership and a new direction. I want to thank the University of Akron for giving me this opportunity. I want to thank all of my assistant coaches, support staff, and players who helped turn this program around, especially our Senior Class which was one of the most productive in our Division I history.

I am blessed to have the greatest fellowship of friends here in this community. I want nothing but the best for the University of Akron and all of Zips Nation.”Bowden has also been head coach at Samford and North Alabama, and most famously at Auburn from 1993-1998. He posted a record of 47-17-1 with the Tigers before resigning under pressure midway through the 1998 campaign.Bowden --- the son of legendary Florida State coach Bobby Bowden — spent the next decade in television before resurfacing at North Alabama in 2009. He went 29-9 in three years with the Lions, reaching the Division II playoffs each season.Bowden was 45-23-1 in six seasons at Samford, reaching the Division I-AA playoffs in 1991 and 1992. He was then a surprise choice at Auburn to replace Pat Dye, who resigned on the eve of the 1992 Iron Bowl after winning or sharing in four SEC titles in 12 seasons.Wracked by NCAA sanctions resulting from Dye’s tenure, Bowden’s first Auburn team went 11-0. The Tigers won their first nine games in 1994 before tying Georgia and then losing to Alabama to finish 9-1-1, and also went 10-3 and won the SEC West title in 1997.In 25 seasons at Salem, Samford, Auburn, North Alabama and Akron, Bowden has a record of 175-114-2.

ESPN reported the situation Wednesday morning, creating instant backlash. Hours later, the school relented.Earlier today, Alabama’s Jalen Hurts announced he would transfer to Oklahoma, immediately becoming the front-runner to succeed Heisman Trophy winner Kyler Murray as the leader of the Sooners’ powerful offense.Kendall, who will have two years of eligibility remaining, was the backup to Murray last season. He entered the NCAA’s transfer portal last week, signaling his intent to explore his options, and visited Auburn on Monday before settling on West Virginia. Hurts visited Oklahoma on Sunday.Under the NCAA’s new transfer rules, Kendall was free to transfer to any school. But graduate transfers are required to get a waiver from their former school to be immediately eligible. It has routinely been seen as a formality.

168,"Center fielder Steve Wilkerson earns save for Baltimore, the first time in MLB history.A marathon, 16-inning baseball game that ended early Friday morning included a little-known feat accomplished for the first time in baseball history.Baltimore came out on top of the Los Angeles Angels by a 10-8 score thanks to a two-run homer by Jonathan Villar in the top of the final frame. But it was what happened next that went into the record books. The Orioles, faced with a depleted relief corps, sent centerfielder Steve Wilkerson in to close out the game. Lobbing pitches that averaged just under 55 miles per hour, Wilkerson set the Angels down in order to record the Major Leagues' first save by a non-pitcher since the stat began being counted in 1969.ORIOLES FAN SWIPES BALL FROM TWO KIDS: 'I KNOW ITS TERRIBLE'“I don’t think I’ve wrapped my head around it yet,"" Wilkerson said after the game. ""What a wild game. That was just crazy. I’m glad I could go out there and be part of getting us a win.“I did run up and get a pitching glove about the 13th inning or so,"" he added. ""I know we were running thin on guys and we’d used Gaby and some of those other guys pretty recently, so I knew it was a possibility when the game was getting late. I think that was a gutsy performance by everybody.”Wilkerson had appeared on the mound twice over the last month, both times in blowouts and in an effort to spare the Baltimore pitching staff. But Friday morning's appearance came with the game on the line. Fans could thank a generous strike zone and some unorthodox soft-tossing for the chance to finally go home. In the inning, Wilkerson retired Brian Goodwin, Kole Calhoun and future Hall of Famer Albert Pujols.While Wilkerson's feat was a first, a handful of position players have been credited with victories in Major League games. Another Oriole player, first baseman Chris Davis got the victory against Boston on May 6, 2012. Yankees outfielder Rocky Colavito went two and two-thirds innings to get a win in a doubleheader in 1968. Catcher Brent Mayne of the Rockies earned a win against the Braves in 2000,  infielder Wilson Valdez won for the Phillies in 2011 and catcher John Baker of the Cubs got a win in 2014.",0.0
169,"It came on the first pitch in an all-star game in York, Pennsylvania, in a front of a few thousand fans.York Revolution starting pitcher Mitch Atkins fired a fastball just off the center of the plate.The home plate umpire signaled a ""strike.""But a computerized radar system actually made the call — for the first time in professional baseball history.It came during Wednesday evening's Atlantic League of Professional Baseball All-Star Game at PeoplesBank Park, home of the York RevolutionThe lead-off batter watched the first pitch of the game sail into the catcher's mitt. Despite the historic change, most everything at least seemed to go as usual, at least to fans watching.STRIKE COMING?:MLB players are furious, willing to strike over economic systemLIKE OLD TIMES:Finally, an MLB All-Star Game that reminds us of what baseball wasThis was the long-awaited debut of the automated ball-strike system (ABS), the beginning of a testing ground for the rest of this summer. This rules initiative trial results from a recent partnership between Major League Baseball and the Atlantic League.Here's how the new balls and strikes technology works: An official in the press box monitors a laptop running the TrackMan radar system that electronically determines balls and strikes. That information is immediately relayed to the umpire using a wireless earpiece.The pitches are tracked through a large Doppler radar screen high above home plate. The radar system measures a player's height and creates a strike zone.No doubt, the change will take a while for pitchers and hitters to adjust.Atkins seemed unsure about it after throwing his one inning on Wednesday. He said it will take a while to adjust to getting high and low strikes called in his favor. Same for a truer but tighter strike zone on inside and outside pitches.He also noticed a delay in balls and strikes calls that fans may have not.“Some of the pitches they call strikes (now) don’t look like strikes. It looks like a ball and TrackMan calls it a strike,"" Atkins said. ""It’s just different.  ""Every pitch I've thrown (high in the strike zone) has been a ball my whole career, since I was 6 years old until now. It's different to see them called a strike.“I like the human umpire, but I’ve been playing a long time. I’m old school.""    The push continues for the balls-strikes system to follow instant replay into the minor and major leagues. The potential positives include speeding up game play by eliminating the urge for batters and managers to argue balls and strikes.  A main calling point is the hope for a more consistent strike zone for batters and pitchers. “We want to get it right. So if this helps the game and the officiating of the game, that’s what we’re here for,"" said Tuesday's home plate umpire Brian deBrauwere.""Yeah, it takes something out of the umpire’s hands, but it places additional focus on other things we’re responsible for. Every other decision we have to make will now be magnified. Every check swing, every fair-foul, every safe or out will be even more important now.""Umpires' jobs actually won't change much, deBrauwere said, because they must be ready to make their own balls-strikes call if the new radar system malfunctions or stalls.He confirmed that the computerized strike zone will expand in the upper and lower zones but shrink a bit on the inside and outside. He said umpires are taught not to call low strikes on breaking pitches that drop out of the zone.Things seemed to go smoothly enough in Wednesday's debut. The first ""adjustment moment""? In the bottom of the second inning, a few boos resonated as Lancaster's Joey Terdoslavich took a called third strike. He stood at home plate for a few extra moments, he and the crowd thinking the pitch was too low.Home plate umpire deBrauwere quickly pointed to his ear piece.That pitch ""looked down to everybody ... the umpire probably would have called it a ball, but if TrackMan's got it there, that’s just something we’ve got to deal with,"" said York Revolution catcher James Skelton.  “As a catcher, I don’t really like it too much because it takes away from my skill at receiving the ball. But if it helps the game, obviously at the big league level, that’s what we’re all here for.""Later in the game, the earpiece stopped working for a half-inning. DeBrauwere had to suddenly go back to calling each pitch, ""flying blind,"" he called it — while trying to mimic the TrackMan strike zone already established.It is a significant adjustment to a game ruled by tradition.One night is at least a beginning. ""If you ask a baseball purist, they’ll hate it,"" deBrauwere said. ""They love the manager coming out of the dugout and yelling at the home plate umpire. They love the hitter telling the umpire he’s wrong after he strikes out.""This system will completely change all that.""  ",0.0

171,"Tom Brady is three days shy of turning 42. He’s about to enter his 20th season with the New England Patriots. And it sounds like retirement is still a ways off.“I have a great time,” Brady said Wednesday in a news conference after a training camp practice. “I love this sport. I’ve loved playing it since I was a kid. It’s hard for me to imagine doing anything else in life. I love playing ball, so to still be out here at 41, soon to be 42, it’s pretty good.”Brady has hinted in the past that he plans to play until his mid-40s, at times mentioning 45 as a possible age for retirement, but he continues to be one of the game’s most effective and efficient quarterbacks.He has helped lead the Patriots to the last three Super Bowls and has won two of them, including Super Bowl LIII in February over the Los Angeles Rams. He completed 65.8% of his passes in 2018 for 4,355 yards and 29 touchdowns with 11 interceptions.RECORD PROJECTIONS:Can Chargers prevent a Patriots run to Super Bowl LIV?FORGOTTEN ONE?:Ex-Patriots RB Dion Lewis still matters to Titans, even with Derrick Henry taking leadBrady has been notably more introspective than he had previously been and has opted to stay away from the Patriots for some of the team’s voluntary offseason workout program over the past two years. He has always reported for the mandatory portion, but the veteran has acknowledged the benefits of spending more time with his family during the summers.“The last couple of years, it has been really great for me to spend offseasons with them and really fill up that bucket and give them the support and time they need,” Brady said of his family. “Because when I’m out here doing my thing, my wife holds down the fort. She has put a lot on hold over the years to support my dreams, and I feel like it’s my responsibility as a husband to do the same for her.“She’s happy when I get back to football cause she knows how happy I am. It was a great offseason, but now it’s time for football and I think everyone in our family is prepared for that.”But there’s one unresolved issue hanging over Brady as he enters this season.He’s under contract through 2019 but is set to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the year. It’s almost unfathomable to entertain a situation in which New England doesn’t work to extend Brady’s deal, especially because he has continuously built a reputation for agreeing to team-friendly deals that allow the Patriots to invest resources in other areas of the roster.Brady’s current arrangement pays him $14 million in base salary with a cap hit of $27 million in 2019, according to spotrac.com.“I've had such a great experience over a lot of years, and I appreciate this team and the opportunity it gave me in 2000,” Brady said. “I play for a great coach, Coach (Bill) Belichick, and (offensive coordinator) Josh (McDaniels) and I have a great relationship. I love (Patriots owner) Mr. (Robert) Kraft and his family, and we've had just incredible success. So, hopefully we can keep it going.”Follow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.If you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

175,"INDIANAPOLIS — How does one become a social media sensation, a sculpted specimen worthy of being a mythological deity and among the buzziest players at the NFL scouting combine?Easy ... just give up strawberry milk.OK, maybe there's just a bit more to the ascent of Ole Miss' D.K. Metcalf, but try explaining the sudden prominence of an oft-injured player who was never better than the Rebels' third-most productive receiver yet is suddenly considered a likely first-round draft pick.Start with that photo on Twitter, the one featuring Metcalf's massive musculature and incredible six-pack that eventually led to an erroneous report from NFL Media that he had an unbelievably low 1.6 percent body fat.Metcalf corrected the record Friday at his combine interview with reporters: He's actually a much softer 1.9 percent. Well then.""I didn't think it was going to explode like that,"" Metcalf said of the viral post of him alongside college teammate and fellow wide receiver prospect A.J. Brown.""A lot of people hit me up, 'What's your workout plan?’ and I'm like, 'I'm just training for the combine.’""Naturally, there have been some doubters.""There's no Photoshop in that picture,"" said Metcalf. ""I know the work I put in, so I'm not worried about what other people are gonna say.""But there's a legion of believers that's quickly growing, too, especially among the NFL crowd that Metcalf is looking to impress.""He looked like Jim Brown. I mean he’s the biggest wideout I’ve ever seen, and you got to ask yourself, ‘Who’s tackling this guy?’"" Raiders coach Jon Gruden said this week. ""So, if you’re a 179-pound corner, and you’re tackling a 235-pound back, or a 235-pound wideout or a tight end you’ve got to ask yourself, ‘Is this what I want to do?’""Metcalf is obviously a physical marvel, measuring 6-3 and 228 pounds and posting 27 repetitions of 225 pounds on the bench press, a 40½-inch vertical leap and a 4.33-second 40-yard dash as he continued burnishing a stunning combine résumé that promises to push him even further up draft boards around the league.COLUMN:Kyler Murray might have won the NFL scouting combine without taking the fieldRECEIVERS:Marquise Brown, cousin of Steelers' Antonio Brown, could be first WR drafted in 2019Injuries to his foot and neck limited his production in college, where he never caught more than 40 passes in a season.

The 1 percent I'm not coming down with it, it may be a bad ball by the quarterback.""The Browns, Raiders, 49ers, Redskins, Seahawks are among teams Metcalf has already met with, and interest seems likely to grow. Washington coach Jay Gruden apparently likes Metcalf so much that he treated him to a brief but elucidating film session at the combine and instructed him to work on coming out of his breaks more efficiently.Still, the hype seems largely rooted in that post-workout photo at EXOS, where Metcalf has been training.""At Ole Miss, we ate however we wanted to,"" he said, lamenting having to relinquish that beloved strawberry milk. ""At EXOS they really cut down on bad foods for you, like high sugar, high carbs, and they really honed in on proteins and vegetables and all of that.""Metcalf isn't concerned about getting too big or flaming out like David Boston, a first-round pick of the Cardinals in 1999 whose weightlifting eventually became a detriment.""They haven't met me yet,"" said Metcalf. ""They haven't seen 'too big' in seeing what I can do on the field. ... So, you know, they can compare me to other big receivers that have been unsuccessful, but like I say, they haven't seen D.K. Metcalf.""But will he see any more strawberry milk?""Gotta give it up,"" Metcalf grinned.***Follow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis",0.0
176,"The most remarkable story in college football just keeps getting better, and now the UAB football team even has a quarterback controversy.A little drama derived from being too good feels so far removed from the drama of just existing at all.UAB (8-1, 6-0) plays its biggest home game in program history at 6:30 p.m. on Saturday at Legion Field. A win against Southern Miss (4-4, 3-2) clinches the CUSA Western Division, and would give the Blazers, only two years back from the dead, their first football championship of any kind in program history.It’s just all so incredible. Puff the Magic Dragon couldn’t even have cooked up this fantasy.UAB hasn’t lost at home since its return to football and the school wants to set an attendance record against Southern Miss. It just might do it because good luck trying to find beIN Sports on your TV.If UAB wins, they’re into the CUSA championship. If they win, and then win against Middle Tennessee State in two weeks, then UAB will host the CUSA championship at Legion Field on Dec.1, 2018. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, though.UAB trails Southern Miss 10-6 in the all-time series between the two schools, so just beating the Golden Eagles remains noteworthy. For such an important game, it’s kind of understood that UAB coach Bill Clark would start his best players. You know, the ones who would give him the best chance to win the division championship.But, see. It’s not that simple at the quarterback position.If anyone watched last week’s 52-3 blowout of UTSA (or listened on the radio because, like I said before, beIN Sports) then you know backup quarterback Tyler Johnston, playing for starter A.J. Erdely, helped engineer the most offensive yards ever produced by UAB in the history of its program (668). That’s a lot. Like, a lot lot. Like, “Alabama’s offensive high this season is 639 yards” a lot. (I’m not trying to compare the two offenses, so don’t even go there.)The point is that Johnston appears to have the ability as a passer to open up UAB’s offense, and take it to a level that Erdely, because of injuries or ability, just hasn’t been able to do. With Erdely in as the starter, UAB’s offense was dreadful in its road victory against UTEP two weeks ago. The senior quarterback played injured as long as he could, but Johnston took over late in the third quarter with the Southside Dragons leading 12-0. He led a touchdown drive in his second series under center.Johnston is from Spanish Fort, and never lost a game in high school. He won two Class 6A state championships, and was named Mr. Football in 2015. The redshirt freshman needed Tommy John surgery on his throwing elbow out of high school, and UAB gave him a scholarship anyway.The future at UAB is Johnston’s, and under any other circumstance it would be ludicrous to even consider not starting him against Southern Miss, but ludicrous is what this return of UAB football has been all about.This team does ludicrous better than Ludicrous.If Erdely, the senior quarterback, can play, then he should be given that option. If he can’t play, then he should be made to jog out with his offense for the first play of the game anyway. He has earned that right. As a senior at UAB, who has never lost at home, he has earned that right.Saturday is Senior Night at UAB, but this Senior Night isn’t like the rest around college football. These are the guys who took a chance on a team and a city and a crazy dream.These are the guys from all over the country who came to Birmingham, Ala., to start a new program, and new traditions.These are the guys will go down in history as the men who forged with dragon fire a championship contender out of nothing.When these guys walk out at midfield on Saturday, you stand up and clap.It’s more than just football at UAB.UAB’s coach preaches that message again and again, and it’s not just lip service. UAB has the new homecoming tradition that brings attention to Children’s Harbor, and this final home game of the season is dedicated to service members and veterans of the United State Armed Forces. The Salute to Service theme will feature helmet logos matching the color scheme of the American flag. Dragon patriots.There’s only one place Erdely should be wearing that red, white and blue hat for UAB’s first offensive play of the game — on the field.Joseph Goodman is a columnist for the Alabama Media Group.

181,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — Alex Bowman won the pole for the Daytona 500 Sunday but might be on the edge of losing a Corvette.Team owner Rick Hendrick, a car collector, has challenged Bowman, part of his team’s youth movement, to a drag race in their respective street Corvettes. According to Hendrick, the loser will hand over the Corvette keys to the winner, a deal Bowman said he wasn’t exactly aware of.It was pointed out that Hendrick sold the Corvette to Bowman, so the Chevrolet specialty vehicle could wind up “going home.” Then Hendrick told Bowman he would pay off the debt on the Corvette if he wins the 500.This is a lot of information for the 24-year-old Bowman, a relatively unknown driver in such lofty circles, to digest. He is part of a youth revolution at Hendrick Motorsports, which also fields Chevrolets for 20-year-old rookie William Byron and 22-year-old Chase Elliott. The team’s only “old guy” is 42-year-old seven-time champion Jimmie Johnson.Bowman turned his winning qualifying lap of 195.644 miles per hour in the No. 88 Chevrolet, the car formerly driven by retired Dale Earnhardt Jr. When Junior was battling concussion issues in 2016, he recommended that Bowman substitute for him in the car, and Bowman performed well, pushing himself into the spotlight after struggling in equipment that wasn’t front-line.DAYTONA 500:All-time pole winners and speedsBOWMAN:Dismisses pressure, plans to keep Junior Nation happyHENDRICK:Johnson, three kids hope to return team to top of heapEARNHARDT JR.:Embracing new adventures as NBC broadcaster“If you had told me in 2015 I would be driving the number 88 for Hendrick Motorsports I would have called you nuts,” Bowman said. “Everything happens for a reason. I’ve been able to lean on my past experiences. It helped prepare me for this job. I got to make a lot of mistakes without anybody watching.”Bowman, who will make his 82nd Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series start next Sunday (2:30 p.m. ET, Fox) in the 500, has been tagged with the “Bowman the Showman” nickname, one he doesn’t particularly like. After Sunday’s run knocked Denny Hamlin from the 500 pole, the nickname might gain even more traction.Hendrick Motorsports, which has won the 500 pole for four straight years, put all four of its drivers into the second and final round of qualifying. Joe Gibbs Racing also had four drivers in the last round.The day’s results make the Hendrick team the favorite in a 500 that could be noticeably different from the opening races of recent years. Aerodynamic changes have the cars “planted” to the race track, changing their stability levels in the draft and possibly making pack racing more difficult.Hamlin had the day’s second-fastest speed – 195.092 – and will start second in the 500. The first and second positions are the only ones locked in. The remainder of the 40-car 500 field will be set in the Can-Am Duels, a pair of 150-mile races, Thursday (7 p.m. ET, Fox Sports 1).“This is going to be very much a handling race,” Hamlin said of the Daytona 500. “We had handling issues in practice (Saturday) when we had only our four Toyotas together. When you break traction, it’s bad. What will be hairy is when we’re three-wide on older tires. We’ll just have to play it by ear.”That thought was illustrated later Sunday afternoon in the Advance Auto Parts Clash exhibition race when Kyle Larson broke out of a line in an attempt to pass and almost lost control of his Chevrolet.Although the 150-mile qualifiers will give teams a chance to shake out their cars at a longer distance prior to the 500, the Thursday races don’t carry the importance they once did. With only 40 drivers entered in a race in which there are 40 starting positions, nobody will fail to qualify for the race.Thursday will be another day of learning for Bowman, who suddenly finds himself the story of the week.“He substituted phenomenally for Dale Junior,” Hamlin said of Bowman. “He got there the old-fashioned way, on hard work and grit. I think he’ll handle it. He’s a young guy, but he’s been in the Cup series quite a few years. I think he’ll be the surprising guy of this year.”DAYTONA 500 POLE QUALIFYINGSunday's results from the 2.5-mile Daytona International Speedway (car number in parentheses):1.

We’re celebrating our 100th-year anniversary and I think it will be pretty cool to put the ‘1’ in front of every single jersey number.”“I’m pretty pumped that I’m going to be wearing ‘110’ this year,” Trubisky added. “We’re just going to roll and everyone’s going to be sporting the nice ‘1’ in front of their jersey number.”TINDER'S 'HEIGHT VERIFICATION' APRIL FOOLS' JOKE CONFUSES USERS, DRAWS BACKLASHThe Chicago Bears later updated their post to declare it was all a prank: ""Happy April Fools' Day!""But that didn't stop loyal fans from weighing in on the new triple-digit look.""Almost got me..but I would buy one with #100 for sure,"" one Twitter user replied to the Bears' video of players donning the jerseys.""Please God, let this be an April fool's joke,"" another wrote.""I absolutely can not tell if this is a joke or not....,"" a third said.Members of the team also played along.""Excited to be apart of this historic season!

183,"We won’t know which first-round selections in the NFL draft will be busts or stars for at least several seasons. But the teams who excel most in the draft prioritize talent and value with their selections. The problem is not all teams can win the draft.Here are the five most questionable picks of the first round of Thursday night’s NFL draft.Clemson defensive end Clelin Ferrell to the Oakland Raiders at No. 4Ferrell was a productive player. He’s an excellent fit as a 4-3 defensive end and should be a solid player for coach Jon Gruden and general manager Mike Mayock. But the Raiders entered the draft with three first-round selections and even more holes to fill on their roster. The draft is all about value, so let’s throw out a hypothetical. Perhaps Ferrell wouldn’t have been available when they were due to pick next at No. 24. But since they owned the No. 27 pick as well, they potentially could’ve packaged some of their selections to move up into the middle of the first round to ensure they would have gotten Ferrell. So with the No. 4 pick, they could’ve potentially drafted a blue-chip player – maybe even another edge rusher like Josh Allen out of Kentucky, who went to the Jaguars at No. 7.More:Redskins pick QB Dwayne Haskins in first round of NFL draft amid uncertaintyMore:NFL draft's 100 biggest busts: Which picks, trades proved to be whiffs?Michigan edge rusher Rashan Gary to the Green Bay Packers at No. 12This is one of those draft picks that was made more because of potential than production or need. Gary has that size-speed-strength trinity general managers always seek. And eventually, he could blossom into a dangerous pass rusher. But for that to happen, he’ll need to refine his techniques to beat offensive linemen in the NFL. The good news is that Green Bay signed Za’Darius Smith and Preston Smith in free agency, so there’s no real urgency for Gary to step in and produce right away. But for a team with quite a few holes, No. 12 may have been a bit early for a project.Clemson defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence to the New York Giants at No. 17Some may want to criticize the Giants for taking Duke passer Daniel Jones at No. 6 overall, but this selection is even more baffling. This was the pick the team acquired in the trade with Cleveland for star receiver Odell Beckham Jr. Like Ferrell, Lawrence is a fine and productive player. But it’s tough to swallow a team trading its best player – and arguably a generational talent – for a run-stuffing defensive tackle. Not only that, but this is the same team that traded away nose tackle Damon Harrison – one of the top players at the position in the NFL – in October 2018. So after trading away Beckham, they used that pick to take … a player they can only hope will eventually turn into a talent like Harrison.Iowa tight end Noah Fant to the Denver Broncos at No. 20Denver did the smart thing to trade down from No. 10 and acquire more draft capital. And the Broncos even selected a decent player at a position of need. But this is questionable because it doesn’t solve the biggest issue that has plagued general manager John Elway and the Broncos for years: finding and developing a future franchise quarterback. Perhaps the Broncos didn’t love either Dwayne Haskins or Drew Lock. But Joe Flacco, 34, certainly isn’t the long-term answer at the position. With Lock – a strong-armed passer who needs coaching – available, Denver potentially could’ve plucked a greater need and let him learn on the bench.TCU defensive end L.J. Collier to the Seattle Seahawks at No. 29Seattle has a history of trading down and getting production out of defensive players at this point in its drafts, and this pick shouldn’t surprise anyone after the team traded Frank Clark to the Kansas City Chiefs. While Seattle needs the help on the defensive front, Collier’s strength isn’t rushing the passer (he posted 14 1/2 sacks in four seasons). He does come cheaper than Clark would have been, but the Seahawks still had their star at a relatively affordable rate under the franchise tag for at least one season, so they could have kicked this problem down the road for one more year. But even still, Collier needs some work and needs to improve his pass rush production drastically to merit the first-round price tag. ",0.0

        In a historical reversal, Country House, left, was declared the winner of the 145th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs on Saturday following “an inquiry ruling” and the disqualification of Maximum Security, center, officials said. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)In a historical reversal, Country House was declared the winner of the 145th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs on Saturday following “an inquiry ruling” and the disqualification of Maximum Security, officials said.The disqualification marked ""the first time in 145 years"" that ""the horse who finished first in the Kentucky Derby was disqualified,"" the official Twitter account for the sporting event said.Country House was a 65-1 longshot in the race, which included 18 other competitors. Maximum Security crossed the finish line first amid sloppy conditions, only to be disqualified after an objection was filed, claiming that the horse had interfered with the path of multiple horses.Stewards spent roughly 20 minutes going over video of the race from various perspectives before ultimately declaring Country House the winner.The horse's jockey, Flavien Prat, celebrated following the announcement. It was the first Derby win for both Prat and trainer Bill Mott.Code of Honor was second, with Tacitus third. Maximum Security was listed as coming in 17th place.Earlier this week, Omaha Beach -- at the time favored to win the Kentucky Derby -- was scratched from the competition due to a breathing problem.Trainer Richard Mandella told The Associated Press that the horse had developed a cough; a subsequent veterinary exam showed the colt had an entrapped epiglottis. The condition is generally not life- or career-threatening and is typically corrected with minor surgery.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",0.0
185,"These are heady early days for Matt LaFleur and his team.LaFleur is now the third Green Bay Packers coach to win his first three games. The others were Curly Lambeau and Vince Lombardi, so no pressure there.The Packers already have shown they have a real defense that can win games. When was the last time you could rightly say that?They too have a future Hall of Famer at quarterback, even if his offense is off to a shaky start.Yes, the Packers’ prospects in LaFleur’s rookie season are getting brighter by the week, with another home game coming up Thursday.But things can change fast in the NFL. A month can be an eternity. Reality bites back, and no one in the league is immune.So while the Packers have to be thrilled with their unexpected start, it is only September, and potential issues always lurk. One that has peeked out early this season is their run defense.Let’s start with just how much the Packers’ defense has improved from what they’ve fielded the last decade. Though it’s only been three games, it’s clear this isn’t just luck or circumstance. Adding Za’Darius Smith, Preston Smith, Adrian Amos and Darnell Savage to Kenny Clark, Jaire Alexander and Kevin King has made a huge difference.You can sense that whenever that group takes the field, it has a good chance to get a stop. That’s because they now have a lot of talent on that side of the ball.But a potential vulnerability is emerging, too. As good as coordinator Mike Pettine’s defense has been in holding its first three opponents to 16 or fewer points a game, it still has taken some lumps in the run game.Last week it was Minnesota’s Dalvin Cook gashing them with a 75-yard touchdown in the first half, and then a 4.9-yard average on 10 carries in the second half.This week in the Packers’ 27-16 win over Denver, the Broncos also stayed in the game by winning the battle up front. Running backs Phillip Lindsay and Royce Freeman combined for 144 yards on 36 carries. Those aren’t eye-popping numbers, but the 36 runs and a long of only 13 yards tells you the Broncos were getting enough out of their ground game play after play to stick with it.Their 16 points came on three drives of 12 plays or more. They had only one third down of more than three yards on those drives, and 83 of the 215 yards total came on the ground.OPINION:How two Next Gen NFL quarterbacks stole the showNFL 100:'Immaculate Reception' named greatest play in NFL historyNFL JUNKIE? Get your fix with top headlines deliveredIn other words, the Broncos pounded the ball at the Packers no matter what coordinator Mike Pettine threw at them. Pettine spent most of this game in run-oriented, five-man defensive fronts – either his base 3-4 defense, or with his base front (three lineman, two outside linebackers) plus one inside linebacker (Blake Martinez) and five defensive backs behind them.But he never really got a handle on stopping the run. Forcing three turnovers was the difference in this game.“We can’t have those lulls where a team is getting four yards, five yards, and they’re driving it on us,” defensive lineman Kenny Clark said. “We’ve got to stop people in their tracks, because we’re a good third-down team. We get people in third down we get off the field.”Pettine runs a Rex Ryan scheme that emphasizes penetration on the line more than his predecessor, Dom Capers, did. Just last week a longtime offensive assistant in the NFL told me he thinks that scheme can be vulnerable to offenses that will keep pounding the ball and have good cutback runners. Both Minnesota and Denver did.“(In the Ryan-Pettine defense) they don’t spend any time at all talking about gap integrity,” the assistant coach said. “…It’s see ball, hit ball. Just run like hell, try to be the fastest guy getting to the ball.”The NFL is a passing league, and the Packers are in good shape there because of their new-found pass rush with the Smiths and Clark, their excellent outside cornerback duo of Alexander and King, and their upgrade at safety with Amos and Savage. But there are teams in this league with the talent and will to run the ball. Most notably on the Packers’ schedule, that’s the Vikings with Cook and Dallas Cowboys with Ezekiel Elliott.The Packers have some run-stopping talent up front. The Smiths are 265-pounds plus, which is big for edge players, and Clark is an emerging star in the league for his play against the run and pass. Dean Lowry has been a solid run defender, too.But if the Packers are to accomplish some big things this season, which at least looks plausible because of their play on defense, at some point they’re going to have to stop a good offense from running the ball.“Overall, I think if you have the mentality of bend but don’t break and hold them to field goals most times, we’ll be all right,” Lowry said. “Today it wasn’t as good, it was more sustained drives, which is never good. Last week was a few big plays, (but) that’s not really who we are. We’ve got to work on it.”If you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

        FILE - In this March 12, 2019, file photo, Georgia Tech head coach Josh Pastner, left, directs his team against Notre Dame during the first half of an NCAA college basketball game in the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament, in Charlotte, N.C.  (AP Photo/Nell Redmond, File) Georgia Tech coach Josh Pastner still has the support of his athletic director even after the Yellow Jackets basketball team was slapped with NCAA sanctions Thursday, including a ban on postseason play for upcoming season.Dealing a major blow to Pastner's efforts to rebuild the struggling Atlantic Coast Conference program, the NCAA hit Georgia Tech with four years of probation for major recruiting violations committed by Pastner's former assistant coach and an ex-friend.The sanctions handed down by the NCAA also included a reduction in scholarships, limits on recruiting and a fine of $5,000 plus 2% of the program's budget,Pastner was not directly named in the NCAA's findings and was largely cleared in Georgia Tech's own investigation.""We admonish Josh for his poor judgment"" in allowing his former friend, Ron Bell, ""to get close to the program in the first place,"" athletic director Todd Stansbury said.That was the extent of any punishment for Pastner.""I continue to support Josh as our men's basketball coach,"" Stansbury said.While Georgia Tech is considering an appeal, the lead investigator said the penalties could have been more severe.""Quite frankly, if you look at the penalties that were prescribed, they are ... in most cases at the lower level of level one standards,"" said Joel Maturi, the chief hearing officer for the NCAA's committee on infractions. ""We're trying to be as fair and consistent as we can.""But Stansbury said some sanctions could unfairly impact current players. He expects a decision on a possible appeal within 10 days.""I just think the breadth of the penalties as well as the length, in my opinion, are I feel more severe than I was anticipating,"" Stansbury said. ""We are in the process of digesting the penalties to determine which ones may be subject to appeal.""The NCAA said former assistant coach Darryl LaBarrie gave $300 to a highly touted prospect for a visit to an Atlanta strip club and arranged for him to meet with a former Georgia Tech athlete who played for the NBA's Atlanta Hawks, including a visit to the player's home and a free meal at a lounge owned by the player.The NBA player was not identified, but Jarrett Jack was on the Hawks' roster in 2016. He never played for Atlanta, which waived him during training camp as he struggled to return from a serious knee injury.Maturi said the use of a strip club for recruiting purposes was disturbing.""It goes without saying that we as a committee firmly believe that adult entertainment has no place in college sports,"" he said.LaBarrie was given a three-year show-cause ban from coaching for failing to cooperate in the investigation. The NCAA said he denied any involvement during his first interview with the enforcement staff and also tried to get the prospect to lie about what happened. LaBarrie later acknowledged that he arranged the illegal benefits, the investigation found.The committee said Bell provided two players and a potential transfer athlete with $2,424 in shoes, clothes, meals, transportation and lodging.As for Bell, the NCAA found that Pastner repeatedly cautioned against providing any illegal benefits, though the coach allowed him to continue interacting with the program. Bell warned the three players to never tell Pastner about the gifts and benefits, according to the report.The NCAA report also noted that Pastner reported the violations after they were revealed to him by Bell.Georgia Tech has permanently cut ties with the booster.The postseason ban seems largely symbolic, though it also includes the ACC Tournament. The Yellow Jackets haven't appeared in the NCAA Tournament since 2010 and made their last postseason appearance in 2017, during Pastner's first season at Georgia Tech. That squad won 21 games and reached the NIT final, but the Yellow Jackets slumped to records of 13-19 and 14-18 the last two years, including a 12-24 mark in the ACC.The recruiting restrictions for each year of probation include:— The loss of one scholarship.— An eight-week ban on unofficial visits and a three-visit reduction from the number of official visits.— An eight-week ban on recruiting communications.— A reduction of 19 recruiting-person days from the allowed number.Some of the allegations were made public during the 2016-17 season, Pastner's first year at Georgia Tech. LaBarrie was placed on leave early that season and resigned in February 2017.Two former players, Josh Okogie and Tadric Jackson, were suspended for six and three games, respectively, for accepting benefits including apparel, meals and transportation.The NCAA ruled that Georgia Tech must also vacate all wins in which ineligible players were used. The school was given 14 days to provide that information to the governing body.The allegations against Bell led to an exchange of lawsuits between Pastner and Bell and his girlfriend, Jennifer Pendley.Pastner filed a defamation lawsuit against Bell and Pendley early in 2018, saying the Tucson-area couple was trying to defame and blackmail him by accusing him of breaking NCAA rules.The countersuit from Bell and Pendley claimed Pastner sexually assaulted Pendley in February 2016 when he was head coach at Memphis.Pastner denied the charges, saying there was ""zero truth to any of those disgusting, bogus allegations.""The lawsuits were dropped this year. Bell and Pendley now face charges for trying to extort Pastner.The NCAA sanctions against the men's team cap a tumultuous year for both basketball programs at Georgia Tech.Longtime women's coach MaChelle Joseph was suspended late last season and then fired after the school said it learned of alleged mistreatment of players and staff, as well as possible NCAA violations. Joseph denied the allegations, saying she was punished for complaining about gender equity issues and was the victim of a double standard since Pastner was still on the job despite his well-documented troubles with the NCAA.",0.0
190,"Paul Finebaum isn’t surprised.In what authorities called the biggest college admissions scam ever prosecuted by the U.S. Justice Department, roughly 50 people have been charged for a scheme in which parents bribed college coaches and other insiders to get children into elite schools in the country.Among those charged were actresses Felicity Huffman, who starred in ‘Desperate Housewives,’ and Lori Loughlin, who starred in ‘Full House.’Schools such as Stanford, UCLA, Georgetown, Wake Forest, Southern Cal and Cal and Yale have been named.Finebaum, an analyst for the SEC Network, told “Outside The Lines,” this is nothing new.“I’d love to fake outrage here and say all of this surprises me, but it doesn’t,” Finebaum said. “This kind of thing, not directly - this is more than I can imagine - has been going on for a long time. We’ve all encountered friends of ours who got into a better school than we did because their parents made donations. I think it’s a continuum of that. I’ve never heard of anything quite like this, let me make that very clear here. But I think it’s just an age-old privilege game that goes on. There’s always somebody out there with a hand out.“And one thing too, and I know is separate from the issue here, but universities now are basically fund raisers. Presidents no longer administrate. They raise money, and I think that trickles down, so you have some isolated volleyball coach or rowing coach or whatever and they go, ‘You know what? I’m going to cash in, because I’m not making very much money and this university is all about money.'”
Parents paid an admissions consultant from 2011 through last month to bribe coaches and administrators to label their children recruited athletes to enhance their chances of getting into college. The consultant also hired ringers to take college entrance exams, and paid off insiders at testing centers to alter students’ scores.Mark Heim is a sports reporter for The Alabama Media Group.

But then objections were raised over Maximum Security's win for alleged interference. After a 22-minute delay to review video of the race, stewards overturned the results and sent 65-to-1 long shot Country House to the winner's circle.

193," David Williams II, the first black athletic director in the Southeastern Conference and an “incomparable leader” at Vanderbilt, died Friday, hours before his retirement party. He was 71.He died at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the university said. The cause was not disclosed. His last day as athletic director was Jan. 31.""David Williams stood tall on this campus, in this city and in college athletics nationally as an incomparable leader, role model and dear friend to me and so many others,"" chancellor Nicholas Zeppos said in a statement. ""We are devastated by this loss. His impact on our community is immeasurable and will be felt for generations to come.""Williams was nicknamed the Goldfather — the school colors are black and gold — for his success at the school. He had been the SEC's second-longest tenured athletic director behind Kentucky's Mitch Barnhart when he announced his retirement last September. Malcolm Turner took over Feb. 1, Williams stayed on as a full-time law professor. He also was establishing a Sports, Law & Society program at Vanderbilt Law School.""David authored a remarkable legacy at Vanderbilt, one defined by blazing trails and championing the student-athlete,"" Turner said in a statement.Williams was vice chancellor of student affairs and a tenured law professor, general counsel and university secretary in 2003 when then-chancellor Gordon Gee dissolved the Vanderbilt athletic department in 2003. Williams' job overseeing student affairs put him in charge of athletics, which he had worked in while at Ohio State.He shed some jobs in 2012 when he took the athletic director title. During his stay, Vanderbilt won four national championships — baseball (2014), women's tennis (2015) and women's bowling (2007, 2018) — and enjoyed its most football success in nearly a century.The last bowl berth for the Commodores had been in 1982. Vanderbilt went to six bowl games under Williams, starting in 2008 and most recently in December. It marked a huge turnaround for a program that ended the SEC's longest bowl drought and a 25-year stretch without a winning record.""I remember the disbelief that people had,"" Williams said. ""But I knew we could do that. And quite honestly, I also knew that the hardest thing of all of this was going to be football because of the size of it and that this is the Southeastern Conference.""Williams hired both James Franklin, now at Penn State, and current coach Derek Mason in football. Vanderbilt has five wins in the past seven years over state rival Tennessee and just reached a second bowl in three seasons. Mason wrote on Twitter that he loved Williams.""You believed in me...your wisdom and guidance forged a bond that will never be forgotten,"" Mason wrote.Williams also hired Bryce Drew and Stephanie White in 2016 to coach men's and women's basketball. Vanderbilt canceled availability with the men's basketball team Friday. Williams also kept Tim Corbin as baseball coach; Vanderbilt's streak of 13 straight NCAA Tournament berths is best in the SEC and the Commodores are the preseason pick to win the SEC title this year.He also oversaw upgrades to McGugin Center, home to the football program, along with building an indoor football practice facility that also has a track, upgrades to the baseball field, and offices and renovations at Memorial Gym among others.SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey said in a statement posted to Twitter that he lost both a friend and someone who guided him in many ways.""His steady leadership and his legacy as a trailblazer have moved the Vanderbilt community in ways that will be felt for generations,"" Sankey wrote.",0.0

197,"Former Alabama standout Josh Jacobs starts work with the Oakland Raiders on Friday, but his role with the NFL team likely became bigger on Tuesday, when running back Isaiah Crowell suffered a torn Achilles tendon.The former Alabama State standout will miss the 2019 NFL season, ESPN reported.Crowell signed a one-year, $1 million contract with the Raiders in March after being released with two seasons left on a three-year, $12 million deal with the New York Jets. The Jets cut Crowell after they landed running back Le’Veon Bell in free agency.Crowell led the Jets with 685 rushing yards and six touchdowns on 143 carries in 2018. He also caught 21 passes for 152 yards.Crowell set a franchise record for rushing yards in a game by running for 219 in a 34-16 victory over the Denver Broncos on Oct. 7. With a 12-yard reception, too, Crowell also broke the Jets' record for yards from scrimmage in a game. Crowell ran up his rushing yardage on only 15 carries, and his 14.6-yards-per-carry average is the highest for the 134 200-yard rushing games in the NFL's Super Bowl era.After that, Crowell topped 50 yards in only one game as ankle and foot injuries hampered him until he finally went on injured reserve and missed the final three games of the season. It was the first time in Crowell's NFL career that he failed to play the full 16-game schedule.Crowell was the top back on the Raiders’ roster when Oakland used the second of its three first-round draft choices on Jacobs on Thursday. As the 24th player picked, Jacobs was the first running back chosen in the 2019 NFL Draft after rushing for 640 yards and 11 touchdowns on 120 carries and catching 20 passes for 247 yards and three TDs for the Crimson Tide in 2018.Oakland opens its three-day rookie minicamp on Friday.Crowell entered the NFL as an undrafted rookie with the Cleveland Browns in 2014 and was the team's leading rusher in 2015, 2016 and 2017.

He went to the University of Alabama and won the Heisman trophy. He was a fantastic player in college and has looked special thus far in the NFL.One thing maybe you don’t know is just how ridiculous, how phenomenal Henry was in high school.As a freshman, Henry ran for 2465 yards and 26 touchdowns. He averaged 7.9 yards per carry. That’s pretty stellar and right there could be enough to get a kid signed to a quality division one college football team.As a sophomore, Henry ran for 2788 yards and scored 38 touchdowns. As a junior, he ran for 2610 yards and scored 34 touchdowns.Senior year of high school is a player’s best season right?

Can you imagine that?9.2 yards per carry seems almost insane. It is so high it seems almost impossible to achieve. 4261 yards and 55 touchdowns would make Marcus Mariota the best NFL quarterback this coming season and that would be passing the ball. Fifty five touchdowns over twelve games is an average of more than four touchdowns per game.Derrick Henry ran for a total 12,124 yards, scored 154 touchdowns, and averaged 8.7 yards per carry for his high school career.He carried the ball 1397 times.Draft folks have a theory where a player can be “run into the ground” due to over usage and only last so long at the NFL level because of it. Henry had 395 carries his last year at Alabama. That is high, but 172 carries his sophomore year and 35 as a freshman is not notable at all. He did get some rest.Story continuesThere is always “that guy” that finds way to put down a genuine stud and disprove his “studliness.” Despite Henry’s ridiculous high school career stats, he wasn’t the top ranked running back prospect by every website or recruiter.I love these types of guys. They are one small part of the fuel that drives a stud like Henry. Some of these same people were stating that Henry (despite winning the Heisman and being an All-American) wouldn’t do all that well in the NFL either.

201,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. – The first tug and pull Bronco Mendenhall felt from the University of Virginia came near the end of the past regular season in a small, sparsely decorated room inside Brigham Young’s football facilities, where the former BYU coach sat with then-offensive coordinator Robert Anae.Anae, who now holds the same position with the Cavaliers, had turned to Mendenhall with a rhetorical question and answer: You know where you’d fit really well, with who you are and what you do? Virginia, said Anae.It was a moment Mendenhall stored away, to be reflected upon just weeks later, following Mike London’s decision to resign from Virginia after six seasons.“Many thought I would never leave BYU,” Mendenhall told USA TODAY Sports. “It wasn’t an option. It was never conceivable that might happen. I’d just keep going.“There was a significant change toward the end of last season. It was pretty clear – no, that’s an understatement. It was crystal clear that I had done what I was capable of and supposed to do at BYU with the time I was there.Bronco Mendenhall aims to build on, strengthen foundation at Virginia“That had maybe as much or more to do with me coming here as anything else. It was reaching that place internally, and when that was hit it was then, OK, so now where? Then it was, this makes sense.”That Mendenhall now holds the same position at Virginia can be credited to a number of factors, including the challenge of starting again after more than a decade of success with the Cougars. Virginia craves a winning program, he said, “but not at the expense of doing it the right way. That was the exact principles I operated on at BYU.”Yet as Virginia pulled, circumstances at BYU began to push Mendenhall away. No issue loomed larger than the program’s shift toward independence, which occurred prior to the 2011 season.“I don’t think it’s sustainable,” he said of BYU’s independent status. “I was trying everything I knew how to do to advance and pioneer that part. If I were to be really blunt about it, I took it as far as I could go in relation to that setting of independence.“After all that and setting all that foundation and direction, there became a point where it was guardian, custodian of that direction – where it was, I’m not sure now if I’m one supposed to be doing that here.”The lack of conference affiliation impacted the program’s national standing: BYU was ranked in the final Amway Coaches Poll four times in its final five seasons in the Mountain West Conference, but just once in its five years as a Football Bowl Subdivision independent.Mendenhall aimed to fill the void left by a lack of conference affiliation by scheduling games against high-profile competition, hoping to use tests against Nebraska, UCLA, Michigan and others to “uncover lessons that would make us better,” he said.“I chose to have the scheduling part impact that, trying to push the envelope as far as I could. Because that was the most realistic segue that I could direct the program toward, to say this is where I want to go, this is where I want us to go.”In the end, Mendenhall’s surprising departure can be tied to a simple idea: After 11 years and 99 wins at BYU, it was time for a new challenge.“I was always said that I would be at BYU and be a coach as long as I felt like I was supposed to be,” he said. “I started to feel like I was not supposed to be the coach at BYU. And that’s a personal and specific thing, to either faith or intuition. But I’d never had that feeling before when other options came.”",0.0
202,"The Houston Astros are one of the most fearsome lineups in baseball. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)After discussing lineups to target with streamers last week, we will now turn our attention to the lineups that fantasy owners should avoid with spot starters and manage carefully with midlevel hurlers.Lineups to avoid in most situationsAstros: Houston continues to be all-around awesome, leading the Majors in overall OPS (.863) and ranking second in runs scored. They also limit a pitcher’s boom potential, as they rank 29th in total whiffs. This great lineup could be even better in a couple of weeks if Jose Altuve gets healthy and finds his top form.Dodgers: This group is the National League version of the Astros, as they lead Senior Circuit in runs scored and rank second in OPS. They also have balanced splits against lefties and righties and have been effective at home and on the road. Add in their formidable pitching staff (third in baseball with a 3.39 ERA), and the Dodgers provide little reason for owners to stream against them.[Join or create a 2019 Yahoo Fantasy Football league for free today]Twins: The surprise team on this list, the Twins rank second in the Majors with a .848 OPS and lead all teams in runs scored. They have also struck out less often than all but two teams. Tied for tops in baseball in home runs, Minnesota has the potential to spoil a starter’s day in a hurry.Red Sox: Boston ranks just 12th in overall OPS (.761) but is eighth with 234 total runs scored. They started the season with an ice-cold stretch during a West Coast road trip but have been slowly climbing the ranks in recent weeks. And even marginal fantasy owners will remember that this was the most feared lineup in baseball a year ago.Lineup to avoid when they are facing a right-handerRangers: The Rangers have been much better against right-handers (.823 OPS) than they have been against lefties (.711 OPS). Joey Gallo, Hunter Pence, Shin-Soo Choo, Logan Forsythe, Danny Santana, and Elvis Andrus all own an OPS of at least .889 against righties.Story continuesLineups to avoid when they are facing a left-handerD-backs: Arizona has been mediocre against right-handers (.749 OPS) but spectacular vs. southpaws (.865 OPS). Members of the D-backs who own an OPS of .900 or better against lefties include Carson Kelly, Eduardo Escobar, Nick Ahmed, and Ketel Marte.A’s: The fact that Oakland is doing their best work against lefties should be no surprise, as Matt Olson is the only lineup regular who is neither a switch-hitter nor a righty batter. Stephen Piscotty, Khris Davis, Matt Chapman, Josh Phegley, Chad Pinder, and Jurickson Profar all own an OPS of .889 or better against southpaws.Lineups to avoid when they are at homeRockies: Perhaps the least surprising part of this article is that fantasy owners should avoid using starters at Coors Field. The Rockies have their typically lofty OPS at home this season (.858) and should be even more dangerous when the weather warms up.Brewers: Miller Park is one of the best parks in baseball for hitters, and the Brewers have taken full advantage. The club is raking at home (.806 OPS) while being a middle of the pack offense when they are on the road. Surprisingly, Milwaukee was barely above average at home during their impressive 2018 season.Lineups to avoid when they are on the roadMariners: Pitcher-friendly Safeco Field has kept Seattle in check when they are at home, but the club has been lights-out (.841 OPS) on the road. The Mariners are tied for the Major League lead in homers and rank third in runs scored, but they are not near the top in overall OPS and are prone to strikeouts. Overall, this is a group to avoid at hitter-friendly road venues but to treat normally the rest of the time.Cubs: Wrigley Field is not an offense-inducing home venue, and the Cubs predictably rank in the middle of the pack with a .741 OPS at home. But the club has mashed when on the road, producing a .840 OPS in those situations. Chicago also leads the NL in overall OPS (.794).Lineup to avoid for strikeoutsAngels: The Angels have been much better at home than on the road, but their venue isn’t a hitter-friendly one and I didn’t feel confident enough in their splits to place them in that section of this article. I will, however, slot them in their own category as a mediocre scoring lineup who is excellent at making contact. Los Angeles has struck out just 270 times, which is 57 less than any other team. I’m fine with using my regular starters against them, but I’m not expecting to strike gold with a streamer.Lineup to avoid down the roadYankees: The Yankees have not done anything exceptional thus far, but their injury woes have been well-documented and we know this is one of the most potent lineups in baseball when they are healthy. Owners can treat New York as a middle-of-the-road foe for now, but expectations need to totally change when Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Judge eventually return to action.Listen to the Yahoo Fantasy Baseball Podcast",0.0
203,"Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly labeled one of Olivia Culpo's pageant titles. She is a former Miss USA.Detroit Lions wide receiver Danny Amendola and former Miss USA/Miss Universe Olivia Culpo have had a long on-again, off-again, relationship.And it seems like they're now off. For good.Because Amendola posted this lengthy rant about her and their relationship on Instagram, then quickly deleted it.But the Internet is forever and his message lives on. Here it is from TheBigLead:I believe there should be a boundary btw private life and social media. Olivia believes in fishbowl lifestyle. This fundamental difference was huge in our relationship. If you're my real friend you know I'm private. My mother, brother, father and nephew are closest to me in this world and you don't see one picture of them and that's for their protection from those who criticize and judge. I believe in nailing pictures frames on the inside of my house to remind the ones I love that I care. Olivia chooses and wants to be noticed on the internet and in Hollywood to make money. Which was hard for me to understand but quickly had to learn. Where as the cost of fame in this world doesn't appeal to me. I play ball for one reason and that's RESPECT. The only reason I'm writing this post is because, whether I liked it or not, we lived in the public eye. Some of it is amazing! I've met some of the nicest people from all over the world and Olivia and I had some amazing times together.. jus like any other loving relationship we fought. A lot of the time it was my fault bc let's be honest I can be an idiot. But! Yup! She's f***** up too! and if you cross me I'm a hard mfer to deal with. The universe brought her and I together to enjoy life, love, and learn. We celebrated that as often as we could. And the sex was f****** crazy too. She gets so mad at me for not posting her on social media, but I think this s*** is sometimes fake, sometimes toxic, but sometimes beautiful. And I felt like she had enough pictures online anyway. Truth is I have a whole cellphone of funny, embarrassing, sexy pics IG would love to have. However living a public image isn't my choice, it's something Ive learned to deal with. Reading all these wild stories about her and I, and seeing Olivia with other men, I just wanted to personally clear the air out here. We've been on and off for a long time and not together as of late! Not sure what's in the future but the only thing I care about is her HAPPINESS. And if that's dancing with scrony little f****, so be it. I'm happy too. With that said! Liv! My beautiful ex-Gf! Providence's finest and Bakers Bay Pancakes . Carry on IG. @oliviaculpoWell that was a lot. After deleting it he posted this photo with the caption: ""Now that that's over, let's party.""Well alrighty then.Here's my take on this:Dating in an Instagram world can be exhausting.MORE:NHL fans were livid at refs over what seemed like obvious no-call that burned the BruinsJames Holzhauer is changing Jeopardy! foreverThis is what the Celtics were supposed to be all seasonDanny Amendola posts really long rant about his ex-girlfriend Olivia CulpoRussell Westbrook's violent block of Damian Lillard's layup was so darn beautiful",0.0

205,"LOS ANGELES - It wasn't supposed to end like this. Not when LeBron James came on board last July.But here they were, the 2018-2019 Los Angeles Lakers ending their season with a meaningless home game against the Portland Trail Blazers.And there I was, sitting alone way up in section 307 with a $30 ticket I bought a few hours before the game just so I could go watch this brutal team close out a brutal season.I'm not a Laker fan, so what in the world was I doing there? Call it morbid curiosity. I just wanted to see how listless of a night it could be for a franchise that once prided itself on being a contender but hasn't won a playoff game since 2012 against an Oklahoma City team that had Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook in the starting five and a guy named James Harden coming off the bench.Yup, it's really been that long.This was supposed to be the year LeBron James brought them back to greatness. Or so all these Laker fans thought.Making things even better Tuesday night? Laker president Magic Johnson surprisingly stepped down from his position 90 minutes before the game because he wanted to tweet more or something, which only added to the fun of this finale.So come with me to the Lakers final game of the season and allow me to show you just how classic/mind-boggling/beautiful of a night it was at Staples Center. A night that ended with a perfect heartbreaking 3-point buzzer-beater by the Blazers and a night in which Laker fans seemed totally OK with how everything's going with their franchise.GAME TIMEI bounded into the arena about 20 minutes before tip. After getting through the doors there were Laker employees handing out Laker license plate frames, because nothing eases the pain of an awful season like a new license plate frame. I politely decline their offer and head to the nosebleeds.Once I caught my breath up there I see a souvenir shop covered in 23 jerseys, shirts, pennants, towels and whatever else the could get LeBron's name or number on. There's only jersey for sale of a retired player, a jersey you still see a lot of fans wearing at the games:You can't put a price on the past. Well, yes you can. That thing will run you a cool $225.I head to my lonely seat in Section 307 and this is when it starts getting good. After the Lakers' band (I didn't know they had one and then quickly learned they were just one section over from me and they play a lot during the game) played a decent version of the national anthem, the first laugh out loud moment happened.Before Laker introductions they drop these huge sheet-like screens from the scoreboard and play highlights on them while music blares and lights flash. The only problem with these highlights were that they only featured players who haven't played in quite some time this season - LeBron James dunking, Lonzo Ball driving, Kyle Kuzma shooting, and Brandon Ingram scoring, Rajon Rondo passing. And then the intros start and the starting five is - Alex Caruso, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Jemmerio Jones, Mike Muscala, and JaVale McGee.The crowd's reaction to the introductions was as if they were watching two away teams.Crickets.The game starts slowly with few cheers, though the surprisingly large crowd does clap when someone in this inspiring lineup does something halfway decent. But the first good clap comes during a timeout when it's announced that in honor of Fan Appreciation Night we're all gonna get a coupon for two free tacos at Jack in the Box. Rejoice! Though we have to wait to the very end of the game. Ouch.Speaking of Fan Appreciation Night, Kuzma comes on the Jumbotron and with all the personality of a microwave pizza thanks the fans for their support all year and how much it meant to them and my lord I've never been further away from getting goosebumps.Lakers fans get jacked up in the final seconds of first quarter only to see a wide open layup at the buzzer not go in. I couldn't see who it was because I was so far from the court:During another break in the action they have two guys wearing Kobe jerseys come out and try to put together a Bloomin' Onion puzzle in 45 seconds. If they get it done they get a lifetime of Bloomin' Onions or something. But unlike Kobe these guys are not clutch and fall way short of completing the puzzle and the boos rain down. But then the PA guy announces that everyone in Row 6 of Section 321 gets a $20 Outback Steakhouse gift certificate and they erupt.I've lived in LA for 14 years and haven't seen one Outback Steakhouse, but I'm still happy for them, I guess.By the way, we're late in the second quarter and I don't think I've seen Luke Walton stand up all game. So I check Twitter and…He must have been in a state of shock.Finally with 3:29 left in the second quarter a fan yells ""put LeBron in!"" which Walton doesn't listen to and which thankfully doesn't get any laughs.With 2:30 left they find Ice Cube, who might have been the only celebrity in there, and put him on the Jumbotron. Cube looked utterly annoyed with the franchise but hey, he was still there. Respect.The game moves along at a quick pace and suddenly we're at halftime. After the horn blows they make a special announcement, telling us to stay in our seats for a very exciting laser light show. So I stay in my seat. And then the ""laser light"" show begins:And the place went nuts! Not it didn't. It was actually one of the saddest scenes of the night as the lights came back up and everyone just kind of sat there all emotionless and whatnot.Then the band, a section to my left, all excitedly kicks in with the Rocky theme and suddenly I want to jump off the roof of the place.I don't, though.The second-half of a five point game starts and holy cow, Luke Walton is standing. He must have found out at halftime that Magic Johnson wasn't joking when he said he was quitting to tweet more.A litte kid then comes out during a timeout and misses every layup and short jumper that he attempts in a 30-second span… and looks around for a 10-day contract.Portland's great point guard, Damien Lillard, who's wearing some neon green shoes, steps to the free throw line and a fan a section over yells, ""Your shoes are ugly! And we didn't like your mixtape either!""Finally, some heated passion!Shortly aftert that No. 19 for the Lakers throws down a monstrous dunk that gets the place going and I celebrate by Googling ""Lakers roster"" because I have no idea who No. 19 is. Turns out to be Johnathan Williams, who's on the Lakers G-League team, too. Sounds right.By the way, if you've never been to Staples Center they have a Taylor Swift banner hanging from the rafters. For real. I remember this late in the third quarter when I randomly glance up at it and shake my head. It says ""Taylor Swift Most Sold Out Performances."" (The Clippers don't have any banners.)Portland stretches its lead to 10 late in third quarter and I start getting bummed out a little because if the Lakers win they'll likely drop confetti from rafters and man would it be funny to see them drop confetti in the final game of such a dreadful year.Luke Walton goes back to sitting, by the way.The Lakers, powered by Caruso and No. 15 (who I later Google and find out it's Moritz Wagner), go on a run to end the third quarter to take a one-point lead into the fourth and the place is acting like Kobe just threw a lob to Shaq in Game 7 of the 2000 Western Conference Finals.Confetti is back in play!In between periods a fan named Santos comes out to attempt a half-court shot for $45,000. I think he hit the side of the rim, too, but again I'm watching from basically the moon.The Lakers now have 3-point lead in the fourth and Staples is still very much alive. By the way, are the Blazers even awake? I can't see because I'm so high up but they are playing less-than-inspired basketball, which was basically my high school career.My guy No. 19 throws down another dunk and man is he gonna love to get traded in the offseason so the Lakers can free up cap space.With 9:38 left in the game I randomly realize they haven't shown LeBron James at all inside the arena even though he's on the bench in street clothes. He hasn't been seen celebrating on the Jumbotron or in one of those awkward fan appreciation videos. It just strikes me as weird that they wouldn't somehow get the face of the franchise some attention. I don't think LA has bought into LeBron yet but that's a different take for a different day.A time out is called and they play that ""I don't care, I love it"" song that easily gets stuck into your head and drives you to almost doing things you'll surely regret. But the fans in Staples don't care, they love it. Everyone is dancing and having fun like they don't know their team has 37 wins and isn't going to the playoffs for the sixth straight year.The two teams trade leads down the stretch and the fans are going bananas. For the record, I think it's weird that they're cheering so much and that there are so many people at the game. They should be sending a message to the franchise that they're not gonna put up with these terrible teams, but whatever, its LA and going to Lakers games is still considered to be a cool, especially if you post about it on Instagram.During the next time out they play a game of ""Wish Air Band Cam"" which goes around showing fans in the crowd playing air guitar. This team has 37 wins and clearly nobody gives a you know what! Also, nobody is close to correctly playing ""Kick Start My Heart"" by Motley Crue, either.Then they go right in to a ""Noise Meter"" that gets all the way up to 10.8 (no idea what that means) before the screen pretends to malfunction because of all the noise. Zany!Ugh.Walton sits through two key possessions in the final minutes but the Lakers are still able to stay right in it, sitting coach be darned.Confetti can almost be tasted. They could actually win this darn thing!But now let's just cut to the good part. The part where it gets sad. The final seconds. Because I can't take any more of this game and dancing fans. The Trail Blazers bring the ball up in the final seconds of a tie game and suddenly my heart drops a bit. We're going to see OT, I think. I can't see OT. I just can't take any more of this.And then, the universe steps in and ends the Lakers season with a Maurice Harkless corner 3-pointer at the buzzer.The crowd barely let out a collective groan. This group, despite the song from before, didn't really seem to care. This 3-pointer just meant everyone could finally go home and call it a year.LeBron and the rest of the team quickly left the floor, putting this season behind them for good.Sure, next year there could be another big-name free agent or two with LeBron and other guys will be back and healthy.For now, though, the Lakers are a mess.But at least their fans have new license plate frames.MORE:17-year-old boy survives bear attack in MontanaMasters: Tiger Woods grabs share of the lead with a magnificent birdieEx-Steelers RB backtracks after calling Ben Roethlisberger 'a racist quarterback'NBA Playoffs: Odds for every first round seriesWhat the heck are the Kings doing firing head coach Dave Joerger?",0.0

209,"The Birmingham Iron earned a second straight victory, as former Alabama running back Trent Richardson scored the go-ahead touchdown in a 12-9 victory over the Salt Lake City Stallions (0-2) today at Birmingham’s Legion Field.The Iron forced two turnovers in the game, turning one into a score near the end of the third quarter as Shaheed Salmon’s fumble recovery off a muffed punt return by Salt Lake.“I thought defensively, we did a nice job,” Iron coach Tim Lewis said. “Our defensive coordinator wasn’t here today, so I had the honor of calling a game for the first time in a long time and we did a nice job. The guys played hard, fast and tough. They played smart and did what we asked them to do. Did a nice job finishing the game.”“Offensively, we just grounded it out. They’re a big strong team and it didn’t shock me,"" he continued. ""Coach (Dennis) Erickson is a heck of a coach and brought a really big salty team in here. They lost their game to Arizona and they were meaning to do business to us and we stood up to the challenge.”The Iron announced an attendance of 17,319 for today’s game.
The Iron defense limited Salt Lake to 252 yards but only a single touchdown and 1-of-3 on field goals. Birmingham also tallied two sacks while putting the pressure on Stallion starter and former Arkansas quarterback Austin Allen, who finished 15-of-31 for 115 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions.“I thought he played well today,” Salt Lake coach Dennis Erickson said. “He threw the ball well and made some good decisions against a good defense. I was impressed with his poise in the pocket and he definitely wasn’t the reason we lost the game.”Birmingham (2-0) was shut out in the first half – gaining 108 yards – and converted only 3-of-9 third-down conversions with two three-and-outs. Perez was an efficient 12-of-20 in the half but was sacked three times for a loss of 15 yards, which ultimately doomed promising drives by the Iron.Perez was more on his game in the second half – finishing today 24-of-38 for 184 yards with no turnovers – and led the Iron on its game-winning drive in the fourth quarter.Richardson got his second straight start after battling a hamstring injury this week but had 31 yards on nine carries in the first half for a paltry 3.4 average. The former NFL first-round pick found little room in the second half and finished with 41 yards on 19 carries, but he scored the game-winning touchdown with 4:48 to go.“We got back up and fought,” Richardson said. “And that’s what we did today. For me, fighting through all four quarters was a big step in the right direction.”
From that point, the Iron forced two missed field goals and a three-and-out from the Stallions while scoring the go-ahead touchdown on an 11-play, 54-yard drive that was capped by Richardson’s 3-yard touchdown.The Iron appeared to seal the game on a fourth-down incomplete pass but an unsportsmanlike penalty gave the Stallions a first down at the Birmingham 31-yard line with less than two minutes to play. Birmingham managed to force the Stallions into a 48-yard field goal attempt with 1:03 to play, and the kick sailed wide left.“They fly to the ball,” Lewis said of his defense. “They do a fantastic job, we ask them to sprint to the ball everyday in practice, and they do it. So when the ball gets free or comes open, they’re there to make the play.”The Iron return to action on Sunday, Feb. 24, at 3 p.m. CT, against the Atlanta Legends at Georgia State Stadium.Birmingham Iron running back Trent Richardson celebrates after scoring a fourth-quarter touchdown against the Salt Lake Stallions at Legion Field in Birmingham, Ala., Saturday, Feb. 16, 2019.",0.0

By Tom Schad of The Commercial Appeal
Arizona State offensive coordinator Mike Norvell will be the next head coach of the University of Memphis football team, multiple people familiar with the situation confirmed to The Commercial Appeal Thursday night.
Norvell, who was also the Sun Devils’ deputy head coach and quarterbacks coach, will be formally introduced in a press conference Friday at 4:30 p.m. At 34 years old, he will become the youngest head coach in the Football Bowl Subdivision.
A native of Arlington, Texas, Norvell has orchestrated Arizona State’s high-octane offense since 2012 and is highly-regarded as a recruiter, with deep ties to Louisiana, Texas and other regions of the South. He has worked under Sun Devils head coach Todd Graham for the past eight seasons in one capacity or another, a stretch that began at Tulsa and included a brief stint at Pittsburgh.
Thursday’s hire was first announced on Twitter by university president Dr. M. David Rudd, who posted that the Tigers had hired a head football coach but did not disclose his identity. Terms of Norvell’s contract were not immediately available.
Memphis (9-3) is in the midst of its winningest two-year stretch in program history, having won 19 games with a to-be-determined bowl game still to come, likely later this month. Following the departure of Justin Fuente to Virginia Tech on Sunday, it will now be up to Norvell to maintain that level of success.
Like Fuente, Norvell is considered an offensive innovator, using a unique run-first, up-tempo offense with a variety of influences. Under his guidance, Arizona State ranked 22nd in the country with 289.1 passing yards per game this season and 23rd in total offense with 473.8 yards per game. The Sun Devils also finished 40th in the nation scoring offense, averaging 34 points per game en route to a 6-6 record.
In the first three seasons of Norvell’s tenure, Arizona State was tied for seventh in FBS at 38.4 points per game. Now, he'll try to bring that same offensive firepower to Memphis.

""I think it’s awesome,"" said David Reese, Norvell's Pop Warner coach and a mentor during his childhood. ""I knew it was going to happen pretty soon. He’s a great coach, a great young mind. He’s going to be awesome.""
Norvell was raised by a single mother in Texas and starred at wide receiver at Arlington Grace Prep. According to the Arizona Republic, he was only 16 years old as a senior and chose to stay in high school an additional year. Because he had exhausted his playing eligibility, his high-school coach, Mike Barber, allowed him to help coach.
Norvell briefly attended Barber’s alma mater, Louisiana Tech, before transferring to Central Arkansas. He started four years at wide receiver, finishing his career with more receptions (213) than any other player in program history. He also ranked third at the time with 2,611 receiving yards.
After graduating with a degree in education, Norvell got his coaching start as a graduate assistant for the Bears, working with the team’s running backs, receivers and special teams unit. He then accepted the same position at Tulsa under Graham, working his way up from graduate assistant to passing game coordinator and receivers coach.
Norvell and Graham, who also grew up in a single-parent household, grew close. Like Barber, Graham was a father figure for Norvell.
“Those (coaches) had such an impact on my life that I knew I wanted to make that impact for somebody else,” Norvell told the Arizona Republic last month. “I thought most of my life I wanted to be a high school coach and then I got to college and realized those are the years you’re going to be the most influenced, and you’re away from home.
“I love the X’s and O’s and the scheme part of it but really, with these next four, five years for each one of these young men that come in here, making decisions that will impact the rest of their lives, I want to be there.”
Norvell overlapped on Tulsa’s staff with Memphis offensive analyst Bill Blankenship, who went on to become the Golden Hurricane’s head coach and, coincidentally, coached Fuente in high school. Blankenship was Tulsa's wide receivers coach in 2007. His assistant wide receivers coach? Norvell.

""He was a great recruiter. Outstanding teacher,"" Blankenship said in a telephone interview Thursday night. ""And then he took the receivers over after that first year and just did a fantastic job developing them. Just one of those guys, you know early on, he's kind of got the 'it' factor.""
When Graham left for Pittsburgh in 2011, Norvell joined him as co-offensive coordinator, wide receivers coach and director of recruiting. They then continued on to Arizona State when Graham was hired there the following season. Norvell was promoted to deputy head coach in December 2013.
“Mike is the best assistant football coach I've ever had,"" Graham told Sports Illustrated, as quoted Thursday night. ""He's the total package when it comes to understanding offense, defense and then recruiting. He's just off the charts.""
Norvell’s wife, Maria, is a Fort Smith, Arkansas, native. The couple have one daughter, Mila, who was born in June 2014.
“Probably the best thing about me is my wife.  We are a football family,” Norvell said in a profile written by Arizona State’s communications staff in 2012. “As high as my expectations are, she believes just as much in me.”

But then he was up against Stefanos Tsitsipas, who has been the dominant force of 2021 outside the slams, and now stands at No 1 in the table of most rankings points gained since January 1. Nevertheless, it had been a hugely creditable effort for Norrie to go this far, especially when you consider that he took out top seed Dominic Thiem on Thursday, and then trounced big-hitting Russian Karen Khachanov in Saturday’s semi-final, losing only two games in the process. Norrie has come to clay late in his career, but it feels like this is developing into his favourite surface. He has one of the heaviest left-handed forehands in the game, loaded with top-spin, and uses it like a miniature version of Rafael Nadal. The result has been a tally of 14 wins and only four losses since he began his European clay-court swing in Barcelona. So while the French Open, which starts next Sunday, has traditionally been a graveyard of British hopes, there are reasons to hope that this year’s event could deliver some more positive results. Norrie’s previous final in Estoril had been a nervewracking affair which he eventually lost on a deciding-set tie-break to the more experienced Spaniard Albert Ramos-Vinolas. Sunday was more straightforward for Tsitsipas, who needed only 69 minutes to hammer home a 6-3, 6-3 victory. It was Tsitsipas’ second title of the clay-court sequence, after he won Monte Carlo in mid-April, taking out Evans in the semi-final along the way. He has become a serious contender to upset the establishment – specifically Nadal and Novak Djokovic – at Roland Garros over the next few weeks. “I felt in good shape from the beginning of the tournament,” said Tsitsipas afterwards. “I am proud of today’s match, I knew it would be a difficult one against Cameron, who has been showing great tennis this week. He has been winning against good players and showing what the left hand can do on clay. “It was not an easy match today. I had to handle the nerves and I am proud of my performance and the way I stayed focused towards my goal.” On this year’s results, meanwhile, both Evans and Norrie stand among the world’s 20 most successful men. Evans is at No 16 and Norrie No 14. The next challenge for them both is to convert that ATP Tour form into a deep run at a major.",0.0
212,"Though it doesn’t play out publicly until this time of year, the college football coaching carousel really started months ago. Even before the first games were played, the machinery for the industry was in motion as agents and search firms began to align ideas on which jobs might open and which coaches might fill them.Much of that groundwork, of course, never comes to pass. While some moves are telegraphed weeks ahead of time, the results of the season lend themselves to some unexpected outcomes. Few would have guessed in August that both Florida State and Arkansas would part with their coaches before they reached the end of their second seasons. Likewise, it would have been difficult to predict that Clay Helton would be sitting here in late November with a legitimate chance of returning to Southern Cal in 2020. Regardless, months of speculation and back-channel communication will come to a head over the next several days as the regular season ends and schools announce their coaching changes, a transition that takes on an even greater urgency with the Dec. 18-20 early recruiting period looming. Here are the five questions that are being discussed within college athletics this week, with information culled from seven people across the coaching industry who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the topic. Is USC really going to stand pat?Though USC’s season concluded Saturday, no announcement about Helton’s future is expected until after this weekend because there’s still a chance the Trojans could play in the Pac 12 title game. (Granted, it’s an unlikely scenario, as No. 6 Utah would have to lose at home to 5-6 Colorado.) BOWL PROJECTIONS:Utah moves into College Football Playoff after Oregon's shocking lossThere are lots of obvious reasons to pull the plug on Helton. Though USC has had a better season than some expected at 8-4, there’s been little evidence during his tenure to suggest he’s capable of returning the Trojans to national title contention, which is the ultimate goal for a program with USC’s resources and cachet. More troubling than the team's record, however, is the situation in recruiting where USC is ranked 76th by 247 Sports with just two four-star recruits among its 10 commitments. That’s probably a self-fulfilling prophecy, as two years of speculation about Helton’s job status has led to diminishing returns on the recruiting trail, but it’s still unacceptable for a school that should dominate the region. Despite these obvious issues, however, there’s a growing sense within the industry that the school’s new leadership team of president Carol Folt and athletics director Mike Bohn might be inclined to let this play out another year.There are three factors that might lead USC to that decision. First, thanks to former AD Lynn Swann rushing to extend Helton after the 2017 season, the cost of making a change now is believed to be more than $20 million. Second, there are no slam-dunks for USC. Once you take Urban Meyer out of the equation — an idea Folt has never been high on — there’s no obvious, realistic fit who checks every box USC would want. Third, Folt was hired to clean up the USC’s image after a series of scandals, and Helton is viewed as a steady and safe leader on a campus where much of her energy has gone into putting out other fires. How that balances out with fan and booster pressure to make a change will be fascinating. And if USC ultimately opens, it will potentially create the biggest series of dominoes of any job this cycle. What’s happening at Florida State and Arkansas? The two big jobs that opened early got a head start on engaging with potential candidates and could move quickly after this weekend, depending on whether their targets are involved in conference championship games. While much of the early focus was on whether Arkansas power-brokers would make another run at Gus Malzahn, that union does not appear destined to happen this time, either. Given the scale of the Arkansas rebuild, the school would prefer a coach who is more proven at the Power Five level rather than an up-and-comer. One name that has consistently come up as a potential target is Virginia Tech’s Justin Fuente. Though Arkansas would be a tougher place to win, Fuente has deep family ties nearby in his native Oklahoma and could get away from a Virginia Tech fan base that hasn’t completely appreciated how difficult a job he faced after Frank Beamer let the program slip over his final few years. Arkansas could undoubtedly offer Fuente more than the $4 million a year he currently makes. If that isn’t a match, don’t be surprised if the Razorbacks take a long look at Florida Atlantic’s Lane Kiffin, who obviously has lots of experience in the SEC and would immediately spice things up both in recruiting and on the media circuit.  MISERY INDEX:Miami suffers unquestioned worst loss in school history; Oregon melts downIt’s more difficult to get a read on Florida State, as the school’s leadership structure is a stumbling block for some of the more high-profile candidates as both president John Thrasher and athletics director David Coburn are considered short-timers. Though the job is very attractive in a vacuum, it’s difficult for an established coach to make a move not knowing about who he’ll be working for in two years. Assuming the price tag on Penn State's James Franklin or Iowa State’s Matt Campbell is too high, Memphis’ Mike Norvell makes a lot of sense as the top coaching prospect in the Group of Five. But is that the kind of hire that would ignite Florida State’s fan base? Does Indiana’s Tom Allen move the needle? Odell Haggins, the current interim head coach who has been on staff at Florida State since 1994, is the ultimate fallback option. What jobs could come open this week? There are four schools in the Power Five where the momentum for change has built significantly in recent weeks, listed from most to least likely to make a change: 1. Missouri, where Barry Odom will be 25-25 after four years assuming he beats Arkansas this weekend. This year’s team has been a massive disappointment, losing five in a row heading into the season final. Moreover, Odom has beaten just two SEC teams in his four years who finished with winning records — Florida last year and Arkansas in 2016. Odom’s buyout is more than reasonable at $2.65 million. 2. Boston College, where Steve Addazio is 43-44 and has had a few close calls in terms of his job security. But unlike last year, where it was impossible to fire him after the Eagles started 7-2, they’ve stumbled to 5-6 this year and need to win at Pitt to become bowl eligible. This could be a potential landing spot for Greg Schiano after his impending deal with Rutgers fell apart – and frankly, it’s a much better job. 3. Mississippi State, where Joe Moorhead has proven to be a terrible fit in two seasons. There is strong belief around the industry that an Egg Bowl loss to Ole Miss would seal his fate, though it’s possible he could be fired even with a win. Moorhead could be on Rutgers’ list, providing a soft landing and a clean exit. 4. Arizona, where the only real question is whether the school can come up with the $10 million it would take to get rid of Kevin Sumlin. Arizona has badly regressed this year and been rife with dysfunction on its coaching staff during a six-game losing streak. Athletics director Dave Heeke has been running over options recently, but Arizona would need some donors to step up to make this happen.5. Michigan State, where Mark Dantonio has said he intends to come back but would be faced with a tough rebuild and an almost certain mandate to shake up his coaching staff. Is it ultimately going to be his call to make? Where else are we going to see movement? The Group of Five level is going to see a significant shakeup. UNLV and New Mexico already announced coaching changes on Monday, and Colorado State is expected to move on from Mike Bobo. Two fairly attractive AAC jobs could open with Tulsa and South Florida, where it would be difficult for athletics director Michael Kelly to credibly bring back Charlie Strong after losing 13 of his last 17 games. In Conference USA, Old Dominion is likely to open. Who are the names to watch?Because of the significant Power Five movement in recent years, the ranks of up-and-comers have been pretty picked over. Outside of Norvell, Boise State’s Bryan Harsin and Cincinnati’s Luke Fickell, there aren’t a lot of hot candidates coming out of the Group of Five this year, although UAB’s Bill Clark, Louisiana-Lafayette’s Billy Napier and Hawaii’s Nick Rolovich are worth a look. Charlotte’s Will Healy and Appalachian State’s Eli Drinkwitz have both been impressive in their first seasons. Among the assistants who will generate interest are LSU passing game coordinator Joe Brady, Clemson co-offensive coordinators Tony Elliott and Jeff Scott, Notre Dame offensive coordinator Chip Long, Clemson defensive coordinator Brent Venables, Georgia defensive coordinator Dan Lanning, Penn State defensive coordinator Brent Pry and Ohio State defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley. This could also be a year where schools take a look at some retreads or coaches who have already been at the Power Five level and are working their way back up. Larry Fedora, Gene Chizik, Todd Graham, Bret Bielema and Schiano are all available and could get another shot. Alabama offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian, Ole Miss defensive coordinator Mike MacIntyre and Liberty coach Hugh Freeze have all won big in the past as head coaches, done credible jobs this year and could be attractive to the right program. Who’s up next?A number of big schools are unlikely to make changes this year but will enter the 2020 season on high alert. At the top of that list is Texas, which has flopped to a 6-5 record in Tom Herman’s third year. Miami’s Manny Diaz suffered a brutal loss last weekend against Florida International that ensures an offseason of misery. Vanderbilt announced that Derek Mason is coming back in 2020, but the future is unclear beyond that. Now that Ole Miss has a permanent athletics director in Keith Carter, there will be significant urgency for Matt Luke next year. South Carolina has stepped on itself repeatedly this fall in making public statements about Will Muschamp’s status, but ultimately a buyout that drops from $22 to $18.6 million after Dec. 31 will keep him safe for another year. Dave Doeren shouldn’t feel too comfortable going into next season if N.C. State can’t bounce back from a 4-7 record. ",0.0
213,"Colquitt County school officials accused Rush Propst of multiple ethical violations, including dispensing medication to players and unruly behavior that includes cursing and screaming at players after losses and becoming “enraged” during a discussion with the county school superintendent.The accusations were first reported by The Moultrie (Ga.) Observer after the newspaper obtained the investigation report, through an Open Records request, that outlined the Colquitt County school system’s internal investigation into Propst after he was suspended last month and ultimately fired as head coach at Colquitt County (Ga.) by the school system last week.Among the most serious allegations centers on Propst dispensing “pills” to players. The report says Propst gave a pill to a player, who later seemed lethargic, during halftime of a 2012 game and promised not to dispense any more medication to players. Instead, Propst is accused of dispensing medication during the 2018 season. It’s unclear what kind of medication was given to players.Many school systems have a policy barring teachers and coaches from giving out medication, including over-the-counter products, and requiring that to be done by a doctor.Efforts to reach Propst have failed, although he’s indicated he declines interview request based on advice from his attorney.RELATED: Check out the Georgia Code of Ethics for educatorsIn addition, the report says Propst failed to show up at staff meetings during the 2018 season, that he missed 21 half or whole days during the 2018-19 school year without notifying his boss, and he became enraged when told by the superintendent that the team could no longer stay in a hotel the night before a home game. Propst is no longer the Colquitt County (Ga.) coach, and the case has been turned over to the Georgia Professional Standards Commission, which governs the state's education ethics and teacher certification programs.Paul Shaw, the GPSC’s director educator ethics, said an investigation normally takes 60 days. There’s also an appeals process, so the final punishment -- if any -- for Propst won’t be known for several months.The GPSC suspended Propst for a year in 2016 after he head-butted a player, but the coach appealed and the suspension was overturned.RELATED: See complete HS sports coverage from AL.comPropst remains on administrative leave, which is essentially a suspension with pay, pending the GPSC investigation's findings. Propst earns a base salary of $126,000, plus a $3,000 bonus for each playoff game. That's in addition to his retirement pay from Alabama.The Moultrie Observer report also says Propst owes $301,317.61 in federal back taxes dating back to 2010 and an additional $143,097.89 in state taxes.Propst rose to national prominence as head coach at Hoover, when the suburban Birmingham school was featured on MTV's ""2-A-Days."" At Hoover, Propst compiled a 110-16 record and won five state championships, but he left Hoover amid controversy after the 2007 season.At Colquitt County, he built the Packers into a national powerhouse -- going 119-35 and winning two state titles and making multiple other trips to the championship game -- and spearheaded an effort to build new facilities, including an indoor practice field. He has more than 300 career head coaching wins in Alabama and Georgia.Read the full report from The Moultrie Observer

226,"In the first of a six-part series profiling the late Aaron Hernandez, The Boston Globe reported the former New England Patriots tight end was sexually abused as a child, beaten by his father and began smoking marijuana regularly in high school.The Globe’s “Spotlight Team” produced the series after hours of interviewing people who knew Hernandez, sifting through thousands of court and government records, and reading numerous of texts and emails Hernandez sent before killing himself in prison last year. The report also includes information gathered from about 300 phone calls over a six-month period Hernandez made from jail.At the time of his death, Hernandez was serving a life sentence without parole for the 2013 killing of his friend Odin Lloyd. Hernandez was found hanged by a bed sheet inside his prison cell April 19, 2017, days after he was found not guilty for the double murder of two men on a Boston street in 2012.Included within The Globe's report:► During Hernandez's NFL career, agent Brian Murphy was trying to counsel Hernandez on the need to always fulfill his obligations in business deals.“No, no,” Hernandez told Murphy.Hernandez reached into his closet and pulled out a rifle.  “I get my respect through weapons,” he said.Murphy told a grand jury that he interpreted it as a joke. ► Hernandez adored his father Dennis, even though he and his brother Jonathan were often ""beaten and brutalized"" by him, according to The Globe. Friends took note that Hernandez didn’t cry when his father died at age 49 from routine hernia surgery, according to The Globe, and yet some believe he never recovered from his father’s death.► Hernandez's high school quarterback Dennis SanSoucie told The Globe he and Hernandez smoked marijuana before school, before practices and after games. The Globe stated this was the beginning “of Hernandez’s lifelong relationship with getting high, even before big games.”► SanSoucie also told The Globe he had a sexual relationship with Hernandez in middle school and high school, a relationship they hid from everyone. ► Jonathan Hernandez told The Globe that Aaron Hernandez revealed to him later as an adult that he was sexually molested as a young boy.

227,"Dabo Swinney has agreed to a new 10-year, $93-million contract at Clemson, which includes an “enhanced buyout” should he one day leave for the Alabama job.Swinney, a Pelham native and Alabama graduate, is now the highest-paid coach in college football at an average of $9.3 million per year through the 2028 season. The Crimson Tide’s Nick Saban previously topped the list at an average of $9.25 million per year.“I am grateful and humbled by the incredible commitment Clemson has made to me, my family and our football program,” Swinney said. “For more than a decade, we have given our all to provide this world-class university and our incredible fans the championship football program they deserve — to live up to Best is the Standard. With this contract, we make a collective statement that we intend to continue pursuing championships and developing total student-athletes for years to come.“Our sustained continuity in vision, people and culture has been a key ingredient to our success, on- and off-the field. I am thankful for the leadership we have at Clemson and appreciate all they do for Clemson Football. I am truly blessed to be your Head Football Coach.”The 49-year-old Swinney is 116-30 in 11 seasons at Clemson, including national championships in two of the last three seasons. His 2018 team was the first in modern major college football history to go 15-0, and beat Alabama 44-16 in the College Football Playoff title game.Nevertheless, Swinney’s name continues to come up as the likely successor to Saban when the 67-year-old Alabama coach chooses to retire. Swinney’s new contract addresses that with an unusual buyout clause.Should Swinney leave for a job besides Alabama, the buyout would be $4 million through 2020, $3 million through 2022, $2 million through 2025 and $1 million through 2027. Should he leave for Alabama, he’d owe an ADDITIONAL $2 million through 2020, $1.5 million through 2022, $1 million through 2025 and $500,000 through 2027.“Dabo’s leadership of our football program has brought value, exposure and unprecedented levels of success not only to our athletics program but to the entire university,” Clemson athletics director Dan Radakovich said. “He has demonstrated the ability to consistently achieve at the highest level on and off the field, and he has done so with a commitment to integrity and core principles. This new agreement is evidence of Clemson’s steadfast commitment to Dabo and to our football program, and we are thrilled that he and his family will be a part of our community for years to come.”Saban is under contract through 2025 under the terms of an eight-year, $74 million deal he signed last summer. He made $7.5 million last season, with his salary set to go up $400,000 each year during the deal and also including an $800,000 signing bonus and completion bonuses at the end of 2019, 2020 and 2021.Swinney will earn $8.25 million each of the next two seasons, with his salary rising to $9 million by 2024 and $10 million by 2027. He would also receive $1 million “retention bonuses” in the spring of 2021 and 2023 if he is still at Clemson. ",0.0
228,"Many have come and gone.Birmingham has been home to plenty of professional football teams -- the Vulcans, Stallions, Barracudas, Steeldogs and Thunderbolts -- at Legion Field, and most of them were short-lived.But a new league and franchise – with DNA infused from regional colleges and a handful of professional teams – is setting up shop in Birmingham for a spring debut.It’s the Birmingham Iron, set to kick off its inaugural season in the Football Capital of the South as part of the Alliance of American Football. The AAF kicks off in February, with the Iron hosting the Memphis Express for its debut at Legion Field on Sunday at 3 p.m.All eight members of the new spring football league spent Janaury in training camp in San Antonio, providing a shroud of mystery as the season approaches.""You can expect to see professional football,"" Iron head coach Tim Lewis said. “That’s what we’re building here in Birmingham. We have some of the best football minds as part of our staff and plan to bring that to the fans every weekend. The team as a whole is going to be exciting and we’ll have a lot of diverse personalities that fans can relate to, both on and off the field.”
Professional football has become more wide-open and fan friendly, exciting fans with spread offenses, and Lewis said he expects the league to be filled with a variety of offensive schemes.""It'll be what you see on Sundays right now in the fall -- a mixture of runs, passes, inside-outside, deep play-action, all of it,” Lewis said. “When you turn the set on Sundays right now, you see diversity every week. You’ll see west coast offenses, you’ll see play-action pass offenses and you’ll see deep-shot offenses. When you look at the Rams and at some of the teams that are in the (NFL) playoffs – New Orleans, New England and Kansas City – they’re all very different, and we’ve put together a number of plays that would look a lot like those.”At its nuts and bolts, football is a simple game: score points and stop the other team from doing the same. Professional offenses are geared to keep the action flowing but defense is still what changes game's the momentum.Lewis is a defensive-minded coach – he was a first-round pick at cornerback for the Green Bay Packers in 1983 and has spent his entire 30-plus year coaching career as a defensive assistant – so it should come as no surprise that he plans to implement a tenacious defensive scheme for the Iron.“Defensively, we’ll do everything that we can to stop the run and pressure the passer,” he said. “You’re going to see a lot of college-type offenses – lateral offenses that go east and west – so we’re going to be prepared for that as well. We’ve got really good football minds and very good football players that are able to adapt and adjust. We’ve got all of our bases covered.”
One of the more interesting aspects of the AAF is how rosters are assembled. The teams are assigned areas, designating player rights, which include 20 colleges, four NFL teams and two CFL teams.The Iron’s blueprint includes all 13 Alabama universities that field teams in the NCAA – along with Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Louisiana Tech, Maryland, Mississippi State, NC State, Missouri and South Carolina. The professional franchises included are the New England Patriots, Buffalo Bills, Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers, and the CFL’s Montreal Alouettes and Ottawa Redblacks.That means many Iron roster spots are filled with players who played college football in the state of Alabama, including Alabama’s Trent Richardson and Blake Sims and Auburn’s Quan Bray and Chris Davis.Still, the questions remain as to who is expected to breakout and become household names for the Iron.Lewis may have been coy as it relates to the final look of the team but did offer up some names that have made an impression through training camp.""I can tell you this,"" he said. ""Some of the regional favorites that are on our Iron roster – the Trent Richardsons, the J.C. Hassenauers, the Blake Sims and the Nick Novacks, to just name a few – they’re doing a fantastic job being great leaders on our team and people can expect to see them contribute and contribute a lot.”
Lewis said he likes what he’s seen from the team ahead of Sunday's debut. The Iron, as the name implies, conjures images of a blue-collar team built on the values of tough running and stifling defense, but the exact identity the team hopes to imbue in its inaugural season is still in the foundation stages.""I would say the identities are something that kind of come with productivity,” Lewis said. “You really have to put it out there and put it on tape. Right now, we’re trying to learn our playbooks, we’re trying to learn each other, and we’re trying to build that identity.”But that doesn’t mean Lewis is unsure of what he wants this team to be about.“We’re still in the process of building it,” Lewis said, “and each team is always going to have a different one. The identity that I would like to see the team have is that as of one being a strong, fast, tough, resilient and durable team no matter what the circumstances. One that will – if you will – ‘forge’ on no matter what the adversity. That would be the way I’d like to see this team develop.”VIDEO",0.0

That's a total of 85 regular-season games.MLB said he won't appeal the ruling and would enter an evaluation and treatment program.Herrera has been on leave since soon after he was arrested on suspicion of simple assault in Atlantic City in late May.Police had been called to the Golden Nugget casino on May 27 because of a report of a domestic assault. According to the police report, ""The victim had visible signs of injury to her arms and neck that was sustained after being assaulted by her boyfriend, David Odubel Herrera, during a dispute. The victim refused any medical attention.""Herrera released a statement through the Major League Baseball Players Association in which he apologized ""to the Phillies organization, my teammates and all of my fans.""""I acted in an unacceptable manner and am terribly disappointed in myself,"" he said. ""I alone am to blame for my actions. I've taken meaningful steps to assure that nothing like this will ever happen again.""The Phillies said they support the league's ruling.""All instances of domestic violence are abhorrent and unacceptable, and we unequivocally support baseball's collective efforts to prevent domestic abuse,"" the team said in a statement. ""We are encouraged by Odubel's acceptance of his discipline as an indication of his willingness to learn from this and change his behavior.""Herrera, an All-Star in 2016, is batting .222 this season with one home run and 16 RBI.***",0.0
230,"Alabama might have the best football team in the country right now, but its home-field advantage needs some serious work.The 12th Man it is not.Nick Saban knows it, and that's why he's always preaching the same message. On Wednesday, he reeled off an 83-word run-on sentence begging Alabama fans to actually, you know, cheer on Saturday against No.22 Texas A&M. It's a constant refrain for Saban, who has been critical of fans in the past, but his sermon seemed a little more pointed this week.""We're going to have to finish, play better, stay more focused and be able to sustain in a game for 60 minutes,"" Saban said, ""and hopefully we'll have a big-game atmosphere in Bryant-Denny Stadium where the fans are into it, and really help our team keep the emotional level in a difficult game where it needs to be so that we can continue to persevere and execute for 60 minutes in a game, and maybe have some effect on their ability to execute.""It was like a Saban rant, but without him raising his voice and throwing his hands in the air. He wasn't done, though.""So, we need to make our stadium an advantage for us this weekend,"" he went on, ""and I hope our fans really respond to that.""That's a nice way of saying Bryant-Denny Stadium oftentimes feels less like a 100,000-seat football stadium in the middle of the Southeastern Conference, and more like the world's largest observatory of public surgeries.-- We're here at Bryant-Denny Observatory, and it appears like two more pints of blood have been ordered by the chief surgeon.-- And now the surgeon will remove the heart.-- Oh, but wait, the surgeon has changed scalpels in the middle of the procedure!It's probably not going to be so clinical against a Texas A&M team coached by Jimbo Fisher. He's an excellent offensive teacher, but Fisher's calling card at FSU (at least until the last season) was his team's commitment to relentless effort and toughness. Alabama is favored by nearly four touchdowns (27 points), but the Aggies kept it close last season despite playing a freshman quarterback.Kellen Mond is now a year older after his trial by fire, and he's progressing steadily toward a breakout performance. To keep Mond off his game, Saban is emphasizing active fan engagement rather than Bryant-Denny's sporadic cheers of approval and mass exodus during the third quarter.With the meat of Alabama's schedule finally here, maybe more specific instructions are needed. Have Alabama fans forgotten how to be fans? Saban seems concerned. If so, here's a quick refresher course in fandom for any Crimson Tiders who think Alabama is too good to need their full-throated support. If things don't improve, Saban might want to start a Friday night cheer practice like Texas A&M (which actually calls it yell practice).Tip No.1: Enjoy the heat.It's going to be nasty on Saturday. Embrace the burn. Don't be like Auburn fans, and make excuses.The heat sucked the life out of Jordan-Hare Stadium last week. Did LSU win because the crowd was smoldering in silence? No, that's ridiculous, but the atmosphere definitely favored the team trying to piece together a fourth-quarter comeback on the road.Wear a Saban-style straw hat or something.Tip No.2: A public service announcement.This is going to sound ludicrous, and maybe borderline offensive...but if Alabama fans really wanted to help create a home-field advantage inside Bryant-Denny Stadium on Saturday, then they wouldn't drink (too much) alcohol before the game.Most Alabama fans don't know what it's like to go four quarters in the heat, but it's tough work. It's a process, and that process starts long before game time. Look, it's going to be dangerously hot on Saturday. Don't be that fan passing out in the fourth quarter. Be safe. Drink something other than Pappy's whiskey.Tip No.3: Students should never leave.Why do students leave at halftime? Where do they go, the library?Tip No.4: Don't forget to scream.Eli Gold is the best play-by-play man in the country, and everyone wants to hear his calls. A lot of fans bring personal headsets to games, and the stadium provides them as well. Don't let the radio broadcast carry you away from the action, though. Sounds silly, but don't forget to cheer.Tip No.5: Now is not the time to panic.If for some bizarre reason Alabama is actually in a close game in the fourth quarter at home, don't be that Alabama fan who is scared into silence.Last tip: Show some respect.It takes one hand to count the close games at Bryant-Denny over the last five years. All that easy winning didn't come easy for the players, though. Bryant-Denny should be on its feet for the entire fourth quarter. When the players are holding up four fingers this season, get out of your seats, but not to leave.Joseph Goodman is a columnist for the Alabama Media Group. He's on Twitter.",0.0

While Lawrence eventually beat out junior Kelly Bryant (who later transferred) for the starting job with the Tigers, the Bulldogs stuck with Fromm (who was a 4-star recruit in the 2017 class).Under NCAA transfer rules, Fields would sit out the 2019 season and have three years of eligibility beginning in 2020. However, according to the report, Fields is expected to appeal to the NCAA for immediate eligibility.Georgia has signed a highly-touted quarterback recruit in three straight classes: Fields in 2018, Fromm in 2017 and 5-star prospect Jacob Eason in 2016.

Printers did most of the throwing, going 13-for-19 for 174 yards, including a 21-yard second-quarter TD toss to Mike Scarborough, and won the game’s MVP award.Tomlinson entered the game as the nation’s leading rusher, ahead of even Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne of Wisconsin.

The second half, I stepped up.""Watch Cheney's highlights from the Hewitt-Trussville game:Cheney said Penn State and Minnesota continue to recruit him hard and Florida State recently showed renewed interest.How solid is his Alabama commitment? ""I'm 100 percent,"" he said, ""but there's schools that still holler at me.""Cheney smiled when asked about Cedar Grove's second-half comeback, as the Saints scored the game-winning touchdown with 1:08 to go. He played a big role in slowing the Hewitt offense in the second half, despite the Huskies having Alabama commits Pierce Quick on the offensive line, Dazalin Worsham at receiver and Tyson at quarterback and Auburn commit Ja'Varrius Johnson at receiver.""You can have all the D-I players in the world,"" Cheney said. ""We've only got, what three or four? When you really want, that doesn't mean nothing. We showed that out there.""See photos from Saturday's game between Hewitt-Trussville and Cedar Grove (Ga.):

We go up 7-0 first play of the game, then, four plays later, it's 7-7.

Witnesses also indicated that the couple had previously had ""domestic issues.""In a news release announcing the charges, police described Briston and Pryor as ""mutual combatants in this incident."" According to the criminal complaints, two unnamed witnesses told police that they went out to dinner with Briston and Pryor on Friday night before returning to the couple's apartment at the Heinz Lofts in Pittsburgh, just north of the Allegheny River. The witnesses told police that the couple got into an argument early Saturday morning that turned physical.While one witness said they did not recall what happened next, the other witness said Pryor grabbed Briston and tussled with her from the hallway into the kitchen. According to that witness, Pryor then pulled away and grabbed his chest before exiting the apartment.Police allege that Briston stabbed Pryor during this altercation, though Briston also allegedly sustained injuries, including a bruise on her nose.According to the criminal complaints, Briston and the two unnamed witnesses then drove Pryor to UPMC Mercy Hospital, where he was found in critical condition shortly after 4:30 a.m. local time and taken into surgery.One officer reported in Briston's criminal complaint that, while at the hospital, one of the witnesses said ""the only reason I'm here was to make sure that he didn't die"" and ""we should have just let him die."" A second officer overheard the same witness saying ""something to the effect of 'she was just defending herself and had to do it.'""Briston agreed to speak with police about the incident but then said she didn’t see anything or know anything and declined to elaborate, according to her criminal complaint.While the severity of Pryor's injuries were immediately unclear, an officer described Pryor on police dispatch audio as having been stabbed in the upper part of his chest. Two residents in the building, who initially called police early Saturday morning to report a domestic disturbance, told responding officers that they saw ""a large amount of blood"" in the building's elevator.Gregory Diulus, one of Pryor's agents, told The Associated Press that the 30-year-old's family was with him at the hospital and that Pryor was expected to make a full recovery. Diulus did not immediately respond to messages left by USA TODAY Sports seeking an update on Pryor's health.WTAE-TV first reported that Pryor had been stabbed Saturday morning.A Pennsylvania native who went on to star at Ohio State, Pryor moved from quarterback to wide receiver at the professional level and has played with nine different teams over the course of his NFL career.

252,"VISTA, Calif. — In the ongoing rape trial of former NFL star Kellen Winslow II, possibly no other witness is more important to the case against him than the woman who testified here Tuesday.Her anonymous name in this case is Jane Doe No. 1.She’s 55 years old, unemployed and testified Tuesday that she was hitchhiking in northern San Diego County in March 2018 when Winslow pulled over, picked her up and raped her in a parking lot after forcing her to perform oral sex on him.“He threatened to kill me,” she said Tuesday as Winslow faced her across the courtroom. But much of her testimony was shaky and sometimes baffling, which may not bode well for the government's case against him for several reasons. She's the first accuser to testify, which can influence how the jury sees the rest of the trial. She's also the only one of the three alleged rape victims linked to him through a likely match of DNA evidence in the crotch area. Her account of events last year even led to three of the seven felony counts being faced by Winslow — more felony counts than is alleged by any other alleged victim in the overall case.It was only the second day of a trial that is expected to last another month and could send Winslow to prison for the rest of his life. But if she's discredited in front of the jury, a big part of the prosecution's case against him could collapse. And that's what Winslow’s attorney, Marc Carlos, tried to do Tuesday when he cross-examined her aggressively.He tried to paint a drastically different picture of what happened, following a larger defense strategy that suggests the sex was consensual, not rape, and that the accusers are opportunists possibly looking for money from a famous former football player.Under questioning from Carlos, the woman said she didn’t scream for help, didn’t try to attract the attention of nearby businesses on a busy Saturday afternoon and didn’t report the incident until four days later.After Winslow drove her to the parking lot behind a shopping center, she said he tried to coax her into an area on the other side of a fence about five feet tall. That’s where he initially planned to have sexual contact with her, she said. But then after Winslow jumped over the fence first, leaving her on the other side of the fence, she admitted she was free to run back to the shopping center for help. She said she followed Winslow over the fence instead.“What you do is you jump over the fence on your own accord?” Carlos asked.“Yes,” she replied.She also said Winslow didn’t tear her clothes off of her after she jumped the fence to follow him. She said she started taking her clothes off because “he told me to undress.”“So you jump over the fence, a five-foot fence, over to the guy that’s threatening to kill you, that threatened to rape you. You take your own clothes off,” Carlos said to the witness. “Am I missing something?”“No, you’re right,” she replied in a nonchalant, unemotional manner that characterized her testimony for most of the day.San Diego County prosecutor Dan Owens later asked her why she didn’t cry for help.“I don’t know why,” she said. “I just didn’t say anything.”That is not unusual. In a 2017 Scandinavian study of nearly 300 women who sought medical care within a month of sexual assault, 70% reported significant tonic immobility and 48% reported extreme tonic immobility during the assault. Tonic immobility can include the inability to call out or scream, feeling frozen or paralyzed, the inability to move although not restrained, numbness, feeling cold, fearing for one's life and feeling detached.Owens reestablished that she was in fear for her life after Winslow allegedly told her he was going to kill her. But Carlos attacked her credibility for most of the day, described her as a liar and established that she had multiple citations for public intoxication after she testified she had been sober for 30 years.Winslow, 35, has pleaded not guilty and is facing rape charges involving two other women, in addition to Jane Doe No. 1. They are Jane Doe No. 2, a 59-year-old homeless woman, and Jane Doe No. 4, who said she was raped while unconscious by Winslow in 2003, when she was 17 and Winslow was 19.Owens also accused Winslow of misdemeanor indecent exposure and lewd acts in public sinvolving two other women, identified as Jane Does 3 and 5.All are part of the same trial, which included graphic testimony Tuesday by Jane Doe No. 1, including about the pain she said she felt during the alleged rape. She told Carlos she thought her assailant was a “terrorist” and mistakenly thought he had a weapon. She also confirmed to Carlos that she made a prior statement to police that she thought “black people always have guns.”After jumping the fence, she said Winslow, who is African-American, changed his mind about forcing sex on her there. She said they then returned to his vehicle, where she said she performed oral sex on him and then was raped by him in the car. She said it was not consensual and didn’t know who her alleged assailant was until months later. Her allegations led to charges of kidnapping, rape and oral copulation by force.Last year, Winslow said to a detective that he had consensual sex with Jane Does 1 and 2.“The defense has wisely opted to turn the tables on the accusers, and will be attacking their credibility solely with regard to consent, not necessarily whether a sexual act did occur,” said San Diego criminal attorney David P. Shapiro, who is not involved in this case.Jane Doe No. 2 is expected to testify Wednesday. In her case, sperm was found from another man, Winslow’s other attorney, Brian Watkins, told the jury Monday.

257,"Information began to surface Sunday regarding the bizarre post-game incident following Texas A&M’s seven-overtime victory over LSU in College Station the previous night.LSU director of player development Kevin Faulk, a former Tigers All-American and long-time NFL running back, was caught on camera engaged in an altercation with a man wearing a red Texas A&M coaching-style shirt and a sideline credential. According to a report Sunday by The Advocate of Baton Rouge, the man was Cole Fisher, a Texas A&M student manager and the nephew of Aggies head coach Jimbo Fisher.Hilary Scheinuk, a photographer from The Advocate, snapped the following photo of the incident:
Jimbo Fisher denied any knowledge of the incident in his post-game news conference, but was caught on camera by Dallas Morning News Texas A&M beat writer Ben Baby speaking with the same man who scuffled with Faulk as he left the field:
It was reported late Saturday/early Sunday that Faulk was coming to the aid of LSU offensive analyst Steve Kragthorpe, a former Tigers offensive coordinator who suffers from Parkinson’s disease and uses a pacemaker. Kragthorpe told Gannett Louisiana’s Glenn Guilbeau that the man later identified as Cole Fisher punched him after Kragthorpe had words with Texas A&M wide receivers coach Dameyune Craig, a former LSU assistant.""Dameyune Craig started the whole thing,"" Kragthorpe said. ""Just trash talking and yelling and screaming a bunch of crap.""Craig, a former Blount High School star and Auburn quarterback, was hired by former LSU coach Les Miles as wide receivers coach in 2016. He remained on the Tigers staff for the remainder of that season after Miles was fired and Ed Orgeron became interim coach, but was not retained after the season by Orgeron.Craig re-joined Jimbo Fisher’s staff at Florida State as a quality control coach in 2017 — he’d been Seminoles quarterbacks coach from 2010-12 — and then followed him to Texas A&M this year. The 44-year-old Craig also spent the 2013-15 seasons as wide receivers coach and co-offensive coordinator at Auburn.LSU wide receivers coach Dameyune Craig, a former Auburn quarterback and assistant coach, is shown prior to a game Saturday Sept. 24, 2016, at Jordan Hare Stadium in Auburn, Ala. (Julie Bennett/jbennett@al.com)NOLA.com’s Brody Miller reported that several sources told him Craig “went over to the LSU sideline shouting vulgarities and challenging people to fight.” Kragthorpe said he was still talking to Craig when he got punched.""I went up to Dameyune and said, 'Hey, Dameyune get out of here. You won. You don't need to be doing that. Move along,'"" Kragthorpe told Gannett Louisiana. ""And that's when I got hit. I mean, I got nailed. He was a young guy. I'm 53. I'm not going to fight him. I have Parkinson's, but even if I didn't, I haven't gotten in a fight since high school. That would be a poor reflection on Coach O and Joe (athletic director Joe Alleva).""That’s when Faulk, a three-time Super Bowl champion with the New England Patriots and LSU’s all-time leading rusher, apparently stepped in. He told Gannett Louisiana “it's unfortunate this situation happened,” but that he was only doing what he felt was right in defending Kragthorpe.Craig has not commented publicly on the incident, though he did send out the following tweet regarding the game late Saturday:

The proposals were first reported by The Athletic.Some of the more dramatic changes include a universal designated hitter, a three-batter minimum for pitchers and a 20-second pitch clock.Other proposals include a trade deadline before the All-Star break, the expansion of rosters to 26 players – with a 12-pitcher minimum, draft benefits for winning teams and penalties for losing teams, regulations that would allow two-sport amateurs (like Kyler Murray) to sign major-league deals and a study to lower the mound in the majors.One of commissioner Rob Manfred's major initiatives during his tenure has been to improve the game's pace of play, something the pitch clock and three-batter minimum for pitchers would theoretically address.While baseball's collective bargaining agreement doesn't expire until 2021, both MLB and the players' association have agreed to revisions in recent years, including a 2018 amendment that limited the number of mound visits to six per game. HOT TAKE: Be careful what you wish for with rule changesMLB 2019:100 names you need to know for new seasonPEDROIA:Red Sox stalwart plans his comeback ",0.0

        Netherlands' Jackie Groenen, foreground, celebrates after scoring during the Women's World Cup semifinal soccer match between the Netherlands and Sweden, at the Stade de Lyon outside Lyon, France, Wednesday, July 3, 2019. (AP Photo/Francisco Seco) Netherlands midfielder Jackie Groenen's route to the World Cup final has been unusual by any standards, one which saw her starring at judo before attempting to represent a different nation at soccer.Born in the Netherlands, the 24-year-old Groenen grew up in a small Belgian village in the province of Antwerp. She won two Dutch judo championships at the youth level and another at the under-20 level, and also took the bronze medal at the European Cadets Championships in 2010.But after breaking a hip she committed herself to soccer.Surprisingly, perhaps, it wasn't Holland she envisaged playing for at senior level. Five years ago FIFA rejected her request to switch to Belgium. She must be relieved soccer's governing body denied her wish.Because her extra-time strike in a 1-0 win against Sweden on Wednesday night took the Dutch women's side into their first World Cup final, and fourth overall for the soccer-mad Orange-shirted fans after three losses in the final by the men. The Netherlands face the United States in the championship game on Sunday.The first of those was in 1974 — when the astonishingly skilled Johan Cruyff was the talk of world soccer.Just like Cruyff, her soccer idol, Groenen proudly wears the No. 14 jersey.It was hard not to admire Cruyff, who died in 2016, because he was such a ground-breaker.The brazenly skillful forward dared to wear No. 14, for example, when outfield players traditionally only wore Nos. 1-11, and now players can choose 99, 77, 44 or any other number they cherish.But Cruyff mostly caught the eye because of his mesmerizing ball control, allied to his searing pace and twinkling feet.He helped the Dutch men's team expand soccer minds by establishing the concept of Total Football, whereby all outfield players are seamlessly interchangeable on the field, allowing them to switch positions without affecting the shape of the side.It was so easy on the eye, but incredibly difficult to defend against when orchestrated properly by Cruyff and his long-haired gang. All the players had to be technically proficient and skilled, even defenders. The Dutch thrilled fans with this wonderful new concept in the 1970s — and reached the World Cup finals in 1974 and '78.In the '74 final, the Dutch took the lead in the second minute from the penalty spot, after Cruyff was hacked down following a slaloming run, but lost to West Germany 2-1.It was also at that tournament where Cruyff produced a magical move now engrained in soccer folklore — the Cruyff Turn.Receiving the ball near the byline, with a Swedish defender on his back, he flicked it behind his standing leg while turning at full speed.Cruyff bemused the Swedish defense that day, and fittingly there was some slick Dutch technique in Groenen's extra-time winner against the Swedes again on Wednesday night.Three players combined intricately with quick passes, setting her up for a low and clinical shot from just outside the penalty area.""I just saw a nice angle,"" Groenen said modestly after the game.A modesty explained by the fact it was only her third international goal in 53 appearances.""We've been discussing this for a couple of weeks; that I need to shoot more. The ball came really nicely, so I just thought, 'Let's do it,'"" she said with her trademark grin. ""I think (midfielder) Danielle Van de Donk is very proud of me, because she told me to take these shots.""A first World Cup goal for a player used to firsts. Groenen became the first overseas signing for Manchester United after the recently formed women's team was promoted to England's Super League in May.She has her mind set on another first — a desperately-awaited World Cup title for the Dutch.The men and women have won the European Championship once.Inspired by the flamboyant Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten, the men won Euro in 1988 in West Germany.The women matched that by winning Euro 2017 on home soil, thanks largely to the scoring prowess of striker Vivianne Miedema.Now they have a chance to go one better than the men, who lost another World Cup final in 2010.It's a big ask.On Sunday, they must beat the defending champion United States, the lavishly skilled tournament favorite gunning for a fourth title.""I hope we'll be able to play our own game,"" Groenen said. ""It's so nice to be able to play in a team where you get that self-confidence, we're really good at that.""Groenen won gold medals during her judo career, now World Cup glory beckons.",0.0

272,"Southwestern College coach Ed Carberry had seen players like Luis Perez -- guys with little or no football experience showing up expecting to play at a junior-college program. But he hasn’t seen one pull it off the way the Birmingham Iron quarterback has.""When he got here, he was the ninth-string quarterback,"" Carberry recalled. ""He had zero previous experience playing the position, but there was something inside of him that told him he could do it. He started out kind of slow because there were so many guys ahead of him, but in junior college a lot of times there's guys out there who go, 'Well, I play really well on ""Madden."" I was champion of my league,' and they've never touched a football in their life.""But Luis was different. He was working out. He also had a lot of self-belief.""As Perez explained when he joined the Iron in the Alliance of American Football’s Protect or Pick Quarterback Draft on Nov. 27, he had played football. But stuck as a wide receiver in a high school wing-T offense in Chula Vista, California, he’d left the sport to concentrate on another -- bowling. But as what would have been his senior prep season ended, Perez wouldn’t let the game pass him by.""I was bowling and doing really well,"" Perez said. ""I was competing all over the state of California, Arizona, even Las Vegas. So I took that bowling route and stopped playing football and decided I'm going to put all my chips in on bowling.""But then when we got to the last home football game my senior year of high school and all my buddies are on the team and I'm sitting in the stands and I'm just in shock looking at all these guys run through the tunnel and I'm getting the chills. And I was like: 'There's no reason why I'm up here in the stands. I need to be on the sidelines.' From that moment on, I decided I was going to pursue football, and I did that.""The first thing I did was to YouTube how to play quarterback. Learned some things from YouTube. Got a quarterback coach and learned. Walked on at junior college.""That started Perez's football ascension, which Carberry described as ""storybook.""After Perez earned his first start at Southwestern the next season, a broken leg struck midnight on his Cinderella tale. But only temporarily, as Perez represented the Jaguars on the 2014 all-conference team.""I had no idea that was how it was going to turn out,"" Carberry said. ""I used to give him a hard time, telling him, 'You're always nervous when I come around. Well, I'm going to be at the game, so you're going to have to get over it.' But he just kept getting better. And there isn't a quarterback guru that he didn't go to. He went to everybody all over San Diego just trying to take information in and improve.""From Southwestern, Perez went to Texas A&M-Commerce. In 2017, Perez completed 421-of-596 passes for 5,001 yards with 46 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. He won the Harlon Hill Trophy as the NCAA Division II Player of the Year, and the Lions won the NCAA Division II championship with a 14-1 record.That earned the quarterback a spot in the Los Angeles Rams' offseason program. After working through training camp and the preseason with the NFL team, he spent a couple of weeks on the practice squad in September.""He took the long road,"" Carberry said. ""He ended up grayshirting the first year (at Southwestern), and the next year he came around. He had played behind two quarterbacks who were Division I quarterbacks. He came out his freshman year, played sporadically. The first game he ever started, he threw for 250 yards and three touchdowns and ran for a touchdown. That was the first game he'd ever really played in at quarterback. He came up and told me, 'I told you I could do it.' I said, 'Well, I'm glad you could because we needed you to.'""He did a great job, and then the next week, he broke his leg. Some guy tackled him and twisted him. His cleat caught in the ground and broke his leg.""The next year he comes out and he should be the clear-cut starter, but the county Offensive Player of the Year transfers in, so now it's a battle between the two guys. Luis ends up beating him out, becomes a first-team all-conference, has a ton of success.""Carberry expects that will continue with the Iron.""He'll do a great job there for sure,"" Carberry said. ""His greatest attributes are his work ethic and his ability to throw the ball on the money over and over and over again. He's unbelievably accurate.""And determined, as Carberry related with a couple of anecdotes relayed to him about Perez at Texas A&M-Commerce.""One of his coaches told me when he was a junior at Commerce, he and a couple of other guys went to Kansas City for the national-championship game,"" Carberry said. ""He said Luis called the head coach of Commerce, who was at a Christmas party, called him from the game. And the coach asked him, 'What are you doing there?' And he said, 'Well, I just wanted to be prepared when we're here next year.' …""He drove his car to every away game the year he redshirted. That includes a blizzard in Michigan. The team's on the busses. They've all gotten there, and here's this redshirt quarterback guy standing on the sideline. How'd he get there? Well, he drove.

""I feel like the Ravens, they wanted me, and I wanted to be here, and it just worked out. It worked out really well, and the Saints made their move, and then the Ravens came and got me.""When New Orleans didn't reach an agreement with Ingram, the Saints signed another free-agent running back, Latavius Murray of the Minnesota Vikings. That left no room for Ingram in New Orleans. Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said Baltimore saw Ingram as a ""total package.""“I think production, mindset, toughness, his impact on games in the passing game and also the running game, the leadership,” DeCosta said in listing Ingram’s qualities. “We’ve got great relationships with people like (Ravens wide receiver) Willie (Snead), and (tight end) Ben Watson’s another guy, and what they said about Mark as a person was as impressive as what we saw on tape. I think it’s a great fit for us from a leadership standpoint, a character standpoint, production, durability, what he provides. Total package.”The Ravens installed rookie Lamar Jackson as their starting quarterback with seven games left in the 2018 regular season. Leading a run-heavy offense, Jackson helped Baltimore win six of those games to capture the AFC North crown. The Ravens ran for more than 200 yards in five of the contests and for at least 159 in each of them.Ingram said Baltimore’s style of offense “was very appealing to me, and just to have the opportunity to carry the ball, to get into a flow, get into a rhythm.”Ingram won the Heisman Trophy in 2009. Jackson won the Heisman Trophy in 2016. Ingram said it would be ""sweet"" to play with his ""Heisman brother.""“Just being able to be in the backfield with him, I’m excited about it,” Ingram said. “I think it’s going to be dangerous. I think we’re going to be explosive. I think we’re going to change the game. So I’m here to help him excel, take some pressure off of him, and I feel like we’re going to great things together.”A two-time Pro Bowler, Ingram thinks he's not just getting older, he's getting better.“I feel like my best football is still ahead of me,” Ingram said. “I feel like I’ve got many more years of playing this game at the highest level and being one of the best in the game, and I have the opportunity to come here and do that with a great franchise, a great organization, some great teammates, so that’s what I’m looking forward to.”FOR MORE OF AL.COM’S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGEMark Inabinett is a sports reporter for Alabama Media Group.

276,"The Canadian PressTOKYO (AP) — Japan’s Asahi Shimbun newspaper on Wednesday called for the Tokyo Olympics to be canceled with the games set to open in less than two months. It is the first of Japan’s major newspapers to make the move and joins some regional newspapers that have recently added to the growing opposition to holding the Olympics. Coming out against the Olympics could be significant since the newspaper, like many in Japan, is a sponsor of the postponed Tokyo Games that are scheduled to open on July 23. Asahi is typically liberal-leaning and often opposes the ruling party led by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. “We cannot think it’s rational to host the Olympics in the city this summer,” the newspaper said in its editorial under a headline that read: “We Demand PM Suga Decide Cancellation."" “Distrust and backlash against the reckless national government, Tokyo government and stakeholders in the Olympics are nothing but escalating,” the editorial added. ""We demand Prime Minister Suga to calmly evaluate the circumstances and decide the cancellation of the summer event.” Asahi has a morning circulation reported at 5.16 million, and 1.55 million for its evening edition. It is second in circulation behind Yomiuri Shimbun, and subsequently is the second largest circulating newspaper in the world behind Yomiuri. Despite the editorial, there is no indication the International Olympic Committee or local organizers have any plans to pull the plug on the games. But opposition is mounting with only a tiny percentage of Japanese people now vaccinated. Tokyo organizing committee CEO Toshiro Muto said Wednesday he was aware of the editorial, but offered little response. Asahi is one of about 70 local Olympic sponsors that have chipped in almost $3.5 billion to the organizing committee budget. It is also one of a half dozen newspapers that are sponsors. “Of course, different press organizations have different views. And that’s very natural,"" Muto said, adding local partners, or sponsors, continued to offer “support.” Senior IOC member Richard Pound said in an interview with Japan’s JiJi Press last week that the final deadline to call off the Olympics was still a month away. “Before the end of June, you really need to know, yes or no,” JiJi quoted Pound as saying. The British Medical Journal called last month for a hard look at going forward with the Olympics. Local medical officials have also been skeptical, and billionaire businessman Masayoshi Son suggested over the weekend that the IOC was forcing the Olympics on Japan. ""Right now, more than 80% of the nation’s people want the Olympics postponed or canceled,” said Son, the founder and CEO of SoftBank Group Corp. who also owns the SoftBank Hawks baseball team. “Who is forcing this to go ahead, and under what rights?” Son added. Asahi also criticized the IOC, calling it “self-righteous” and also lambasted IOC vice president John Coates. Last week, Coates was asked if the Olympics would be held if a state of emergency were in force. “Absolutely, yes,” he replied. The newspaper said there was a “huge gap” between Coates' words and the sentiments “of the people.” “Despite its overgrown size and excessive commercialism and many other problems, the Olympics have been supported because of empathy for its ideals. ... But what is the reality now?” Asahi asked. On Tuesday, the Japanese government said a warning by the United States to avoid travel to Japan would have no impact on holding the Olympics. Japan has officially spent $15.4 billion to organize the Olympics, and government audits suggest it might be much larger. The IOC gets billions from selling broadcast rights, which amounts to about 75% of its income. Public opinion polls in Japan show between 60-80% want the Olympics canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and an online petition asking the games be canceled has gained 400,000 signatures in a few weeks. Tokyo, Osaka and other regions of the country are under a state of emergency that is likely to be extended past its May 31 expiration. Organizers and the IOC, often citing the authority of the World Health Organization, say the games can be held safely with 15,000 Olympic and Paralympic athletes entering Japan, joined by tens of thousands of judges, officials, sponsors, broadcasters and media. Fans from abroad have already been banned, and organizers are to announce next month if any fans at all will be allowed into Olympic venues. ___ Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi contributed to this report. ___ More AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Stephen Wade And Kantaro Komiya, The Associated Press",0.0

280,"Notre Dame was blown out of the College Football Playoffs, and some people are fuming that the committee wasted a valuable playoff spot on a school that didn't deserve it. The team finished undefeated while sporting the ninth-ranked defense in the country and many felt the Fighting Irish deserved to be in the hunt. Others feel the lack of a conference title and weak schedule should've had Notre Dame on the outside looking in, with a more deserving team taking the spot -- and history is on their side. What do you think? PERSPECTIVESSay what you will about Notre Dame, but the team finished undefeated while playing the top universities in the country. The Fighting Irish's wins against Michigan, Stanford and Syracuse -- all top-15 teams at the time of their respective games -- are proof that Notre Dame belonged in the playoff.People are crying over the lack of a conference championship like it is the end all, be all of determining eligibility. Notre Dame was one of the four top schools in the country. They just had a bad day against Clemson. There is no arguing that. But they deserved that spot.Need proof Notre Dame didn't belong in the playoff? Look no further than the scoreboard.The Fighting Irish managed to play fewer games and still gain a berth in the College Football Playoff. Every other qualified team had one more monumental test just to be considered for the honor, while Notre Dame sat at home enjoying Friday and Saturday like every other schmuck in the country.Just because Notre Dame is Notre Dame, it gets special consideration. Brand equity shouldn't be a requisite for qualification. The Fighting Irish should've been left out of the bracket. The blowout loss against Clemson is further evidence that the Fighting Irish were never serious contenders for a national title.VIDEOThe Tylt is focused on debates and conversations around news, current events and pop culture.

283,"It happened once again. Only this one was more painful.Another September collapse for the Chicago Cubs.A year ago, they blew a five-game lead in September, lost Game 163 to the Milwaukee Brewers to lose the NL Central and 24 hours later, dropped the wild-card game against the Colorado Rockies.This time, they won’t even get to October for the first time since 2014.It may be the official first day of fall, but winter has already arrived in Chicago.So break out the heavy coats, long underwear and gloves, and sit back, because the Cubs are about to make changes.Lots and lots of changes.Joe Maddon, who had a sensational five-year run in Chicago, will be gone, with a few of the coaches headed out of the door.The entire team, outside of shortstop Javy Baez, catcher Willson Contreras and starter Kyle Hendricks, could be placed on the trade block.By the time they show up in Mesa, Ariz., for spring training in February, this team may barely be recognizable to the one that won the 2016 World Series.POWER RANKINGS:Astros take top spot into season's final weekThe Cubs’ front office, after watching this team play.500 baseball (51-51) since May 31, were contemplating an overhaul, anyway, but along came the Wrigley Field Massacre over the weekend, and now they can’t start the off-season quick enough.This is a team that had a 3.5-game division lead on the Cardinals on Aug. 9.They opened this past weekend three games back, and ended it seven games out.The Cubs suffered their first four-game sweep against the Cardinals at Wrigley Field since Warren Harding was president in 1921, officially eliminating them from the NL Central race.Considering they trail the Milwaukee Brewers and Washington Nationals by four games in the wild-card race, it should be only a formality when those faint dreams are squashed too.And now the changes will swiftly be coming, starting with Maddon.The Cubs front office isn’t solely blaming Maddon, beleaguered closer Craig Kimbrel or their late rash of injuries for this lost season, but president Theo Epstein and his front-office team haven’t been this frustrated since their arrival in 2011.It’s humiliating to have the highest payroll in the National League, which will require them to pay a luxury tax, and completely miss the playoffs. Their payroll dwarfs the Cardinals and the Brewers .Perhaps just as painful, the Cubs were easily the most aggressive team at the trade deadline in the division, particularly with the acquisition of slugger Nick Castellanos, who has hit 15 homers with 35 RBI in just 48 games.And yet, the team that didn’t do a damn thing at the deadline, the Cardinals – whose only move was shedding payroll by dumping infielder Jedd Gyorko – outclassed them these final two months, going 30-11 after the All-Star break.The Cubs don’t plan to address Maddon’s future until the season ends, but they didn’t need to put on a poker face, already telegraphing their decision for the past year. They refused to grant him an extension last winter, engage in contract talks at any point all season, and still haven’t discussed his future.Epstein’s recent comments on his radio show, saying how the Cubs have badly underachieved, playing uninspired baseball, and don’t believe injuries can be used as an excuse, were all the words needed to reinforce what is coming ahead.Maddon will be out.David Ross, the most famous backup catcher in Cubs’ history, could be in.Maddon, the only manager to lead the Cubs to four consecutive playoff berths, and the first since 1908 to win a World Series, shouldn’t have to wait long before landing one last gig.The San Diego Padres, who fired Andy Green, are well aware of Maddon’s dazzling resume with young and talented teams. The New York Mets love their stars, and would steal back page headlines with Maddon running the show. The Philadelphia Phillies are desperate to win, and if they decide to dump Gabe Kapler, bringing Maddon back home to Pennsylvania would be a coup.“I’ve had a blast this year,’’ Maddon told reporters Sunday before their final home game. ""I’m not just saying that. I had a great time since I’ve arrived.’’The Cubs’ players will publicly support Maddon in interviews this last week, just like every team does when their manager is on the hot seat. Come on, when’s the last time a player called for a manager’s firing? Every player knows the drill. Even those who believe that Maddon’s message may be getting old and that new blood and energy is needed, would never dare say it publicly.At least the Cubs, delay the inevitable this week. They have a three-day vacation to Pittsburgh starting Tuesday where the hapless Pirates await. The last time the Cubs saw these guys, they outscored them, 47-15. And the Pirates have only gotten worse with All-Star closer Felipe Vazquez now sitting in jail with charges of sexually assaulting a child.And while the Cubs should win in Pittsburgh, the Nationals finish the season at home with five games against the Phillies and three against the contending Cleveland Indians. The Brewers have a three-game series against those pesky Cincinnati Reds, before going to Colorado.That playoff door could be kept slightly ajar.Yet, as much sheer pleasure the Cardinals got by clinching a playoff berth on the Cubs’ home field, imagine doubling their joy by officially eliminating the Cubs from the postseason in front of their own fans at Busch Stadium this weekend.Last call has come on these Cubs’ championship legacy.Follow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale",0.0

286,"The Canadian PressTOKYO (AP) — Japan’s Asahi Shimbun newspaper on Wednesday called for the Tokyo Olympics to be canceled with the games set to open in less than two months. It is the first of Japan’s major newspapers to make the move and joins some regional newspapers that have recently added to the growing opposition to holding the Olympics. Coming out against the Olympics could be significant since the newspaper, like many in Japan, is a sponsor of the postponed Tokyo Games that are scheduled to open on July 23. Asahi is typically liberal-leaning and often opposes the ruling party led by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. “We cannot think it’s rational to host the Olympics in the city this summer,” the newspaper said in its editorial under a headline that read: “We Demand PM Suga Decide Cancellation."" “Distrust and backlash against the reckless national government, Tokyo government and stakeholders in the Olympics are nothing but escalating,” the editorial added. ""We demand Prime Minister Suga to calmly evaluate the circumstances and decide the cancellation of the summer event.” Asahi has a morning circulation reported at 5.16 million, and 1.55 million for its evening edition. It is second in circulation behind Yomiuri Shimbun, and subsequently is the second largest circulating newspaper in the world behind Yomiuri. Despite the editorial, there is no indication the International Olympic Committee or local organizers have any plans to pull the plug on the games. But opposition is mounting with only a tiny percentage of Japanese people now vaccinated. Tokyo organizing committee CEO Toshiro Muto said Wednesday he was aware of the editorial, but offered little response. Asahi is one of about 70 local Olympic sponsors that have chipped in almost $3.5 billion to the organizing committee budget. It is also one of a half dozen newspapers that are sponsors. “Of course, different press organizations have different views. And that’s very natural,"" Muto said, adding local partners, or sponsors, continued to offer “support.” Senior IOC member Richard Pound said in an interview with Japan’s JiJi Press last week that the final deadline to call off the Olympics was still a month away. “Before the end of June, you really need to know, yes or no,” JiJi quoted Pound as saying. The British Medical Journal called last month for a hard look at going forward with the Olympics. Local medical officials have also been skeptical, and billionaire businessman Masayoshi Son suggested over the weekend that the IOC was forcing the Olympics on Japan. ""Right now, more than 80% of the nation’s people want the Olympics postponed or canceled,” said Son, the founder and CEO of SoftBank Group Corp. who also owns the SoftBank Hawks baseball team. “Who is forcing this to go ahead, and under what rights?” Son added. Asahi also criticized the IOC, calling it “self-righteous” and also lambasted IOC vice president John Coates. Last week, Coates was asked if the Olympics would be held if a state of emergency were in force. “Absolutely, yes,” he replied. The newspaper said there was a “huge gap” between Coates' words and the sentiments “of the people.” “Despite its overgrown size and excessive commercialism and many other problems, the Olympics have been supported because of empathy for its ideals. ... But what is the reality now?” Asahi asked. On Tuesday, the Japanese government said a warning by the United States to avoid travel to Japan would have no impact on holding the Olympics. Japan has officially spent $15.4 billion to organize the Olympics, and government audits suggest it might be much larger. The IOC gets billions from selling broadcast rights, which amounts to about 75% of its income. Public opinion polls in Japan show between 60-80% want the Olympics canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and an online petition asking the games be canceled has gained 400,000 signatures in a few weeks. Tokyo, Osaka and other regions of the country are under a state of emergency that is likely to be extended past its May 31 expiration. Organizers and the IOC, often citing the authority of the World Health Organization, say the games can be held safely with 15,000 Olympic and Paralympic athletes entering Japan, joined by tens of thousands of judges, officials, sponsors, broadcasters and media. Fans from abroad have already been banned, and organizers are to announce next month if any fans at all will be allowed into Olympic venues. ___ Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi contributed to this report. ___ More AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Stephen Wade And Kantaro Komiya, The Associated Press",0.0
287,"Aaron Hernandez hangs his head during his arraignment for the murder of Odin Lloyd in 2013. (AP)Jonathan (D.J.) Hernandez released a statement Tuesday. It was his first public comment since his brother Aaron took his own life on April 19. It was a tease, with the promise of new information to come. It was designed to increase interest in what Jonathan might be able to reveal.“Many stories about my brother’s life have been shared with the public – except the story Aaron was brave enough to share with our mother and me,” Jonathan Hernandez said in the statement. “It’s the one story he wanted us to share with the world. It is Aaron’s truth.”Only, Jonathan chose not to share that story.Maybe the promise of it wrings more money out of a television show. Maybe it scores a personal media deal. In the interim, it only enflamed interest in why Hernandez, the former New England Patriots star serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole for murder, who hanged himself with a prison bed sheet last month.Even after that “truth” is revealed, we may never fully know why Hernandez decided to take his own life. His death came just five days after being found not guilty of a 2012 double homicide in Boston. He was still serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd.His death stunned his family and attorneys, who say they saw no indications of pending suicide. Letters left behind offer varying hints. Speculation has ranged from a plot to enrich his fiancée and their 4-year-old daughter via some lost bonus money from the Patriots (still a long shot) to the hiding of personal secrets (still lacking any proof). Jonathan’s statement certainly only fuels the latter theory.The release in recent weeks of hundreds of pages of records detailing Hernandez’s time behind bars in Massachusetts, however, may point to a far more likely motive.Hernandez’s life was awful. About as awful as maximum security prison should be for a convicted murderer. And it was unlikely to improve with 50 or 60 years still to serve.Story continuesThat prison is hard is not news, but Hernandez entered into incarceration with a cocksure attitude and tried to present a hardened edge throughout his nearly four years in custody.“This place ain’t [expletive] to me,” Hernandez once told officers at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Lancaster, Massachusetts, according to an incident report. “I’ll run this place and keep running [expletive]. Prison ain’t [expletive] to me.”His truth on this matter was not so bold – his life was marked by violent fights, attempts by other inmates to extort and intimidate him and outbursts of frustration at the arbitrary strictness of inmate life.Hernandez, who traded in a 7,100-square-foot mansion and a $40 million NFL contract for a 7-by-10-foot cell was not running anything in prison.He was surrounded by danger, pressure and, at times, just pathetic ridiculousness.On the night of Nov. 20, 2013, Aaron Hernandez received a delivery from the jail commissary to his cell in Bristol County [Massachusetts] Jail, where he was housed as he awaited trial for the murder of Odin Lloyd in near by North Attleborough, Massachusetts. (He would be convicted of that crime). The delivery included some cakes, breakfast bars, cosmetics and a whole bunch of honey buns, two dozen in total.Hernandez was on Disciplinary Detention Status at the time, a common occurrence during his imprisonment. This one was 30 days for possessing 15-feet of “fishing line” used to pass notes, and threatening to beat up the officer who discovered it if the two ever met outside the jail.Hernandez knew part of his punishment called for a prohibition of commissary. He also knew the mistake – he shouldn’t have received the delivery – would soon be discovered, and corrections officers would confiscate his food. So Hernandez, who once lived a life where he could, and often did, have anything he pleased, sat alone in the middle of the night, as the 20th turned into the 21st, and began to eat, desperately stuffing his face before he lost what little he was allowed to possess.He ate one honey bun and then another. And another. And another. Each was individually wrapped, so the trash began to pile up, as Hernandez plowed through his order. He alternated sleep with more and more of the pastries. This was Man vs. Food, Bristol County House of Corrections Edition.By the time the guards realized the delivery error, Hernandez had polished off 20 honey buns. Just four remained.“I’m a smart dude,” Hernandez told Major James Lancaster, according to a jail incident report. “I knew you’d be coming for this stuff … that’s why I ate as much food as I could.”Hernandez then promptly asked if he could eat the final four honey buns. The request was declined. The honey buns were seized.“I am so hungry,” Hernandez said.Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center is where Aaron Hernandez spent the final two years of his life. (AP)Prison-grade confectioneries were the least of Hernandez’s problems behind bars, but they revealed how far a once-glamorous life had fallen. According to jail and prison records, Hernandez struggled with everything from routine disciplinary checks, to getting along with other inmates, to frustrations about having so few people to talk with.In Bristol County Jail, where he served about 22 months, Hernandez was charged with 21 disciplinary offenses stemming from 12 separate incidents, according to records. At the Souza-Baranowski prison, where he spent two years, there were 78 more disciplinary offenses and 12 major incidents, according to records.There were at least four physical altercations, with Hernandez often challenged by other inmates. He was caught with a nearly 6-inch shiv at one point. At times he was treated for cuts, bruises and reddened fists after battles so intense guards couldn’t pull the men apart without using mace.“Hernandez struck [name redacted] with a closed fist to the face and both men engage[d] in a physical altercation,” one Souza-Baranowski incident report detailed. “The combatants ignored several direct orders to cease their actions and chemical agent was utilized to separate the inmates.”Another time, in Bristol County, he and an inmate were placed in individual cages in the “yard” for their designated hour outside their cell. An argument ensued and, unable to get at the other man, they proceeded to spit on each other through the fencing.After fights, Hernandez could appear despondent, according to guards. While prison records labeled Hernandez a member of the “Bloods Street Gang,” many inmates told authorities that he mostly “kept to himself” and tried to engage in spiritual behavior. If he thought being a football star would endear him to others, it often worked the other way, with convicts challenging him.His fame made him a target for everything. In Bristol County he once received a note, later confiscated by guards, from another inmate offering to “look out” for him if he would use his resources and connections to bail the inmate out. The offer made little sense – once bailed out, how would the inmate be able to “look out” for Hernandez?In other incidents, Hernandez complained about his mail being read by prison officials, letters he wrote being seized and other mundane tasks. He once physically tore up a letter in front of guards and then ate it so they couldn’t keep it. “I’ll eat the [expletive] and then you don’t get [expletive],” Hernandez shouted according to an incident report.He complained about body cavity, strip and cell searches. He often called the jail “corrupt.” He argued guards were unnecessarily intrusive in his life. “You’re overdoing your job,” he shouted at one, according to a report.He was known, in fits of extreme frustration, to kick and pound his door and shout for assistance.“His aggressive tone … has become an excessive habit when he does not receive what he wants, when he wants it,” one Bristol County guard wrote in a report. “He is constantly kicking his cell door and screaming at the top of his lungs utilizing profanity at times when he wants something, regardless of how miniscule it is. It is not uncommon for Hernandez to kick his cell door constantly until an officer approaches his cell merely to ask the officer for the current time.”As angry as he often got with corrections officers, he also seemed to seek them out. Prison is filled with high school dropouts and the mentally unstable. Despite the tattoos and criminal acts, Hernandez, who grew up in a two-parent, working-class home, attended three years of college and thrived in the demanding world of Bill Belichick’s Patriots. Mentally, at least, corrections officers were more of a peer group.At one point during his stay in Bristol, Hernandez was ordered to stay away from the guards’ area during his time outside his cell, as they were not there to socialize with him.During his two murder trials, Hernandez regularly bounced into court with a smile. He hugged and chatted with his attorneys. He was a happy-go-lucky defendant, seemingly grasping on the brief respite of normalcy – if a homicide case can be deemed normal.His life in prison was anything but, though. There was no respect there, not from other inmates, not from guards, not from the system. Hard time didn’t appear to harden him. His requests for more food, a cellmate he liked or anything else was always summarily dismissed. He was a nobody.With the possibility of winning an appeal for a new trial on the Lloyd murder unlikely, and subsequently earning an acquittal even less likely, Hernandez’s challenging and dispiriting reality must have set in.The motives for suicide are complicated, personal and perhaps never fully understood. Maybe Jonathan Hernandez’s promised “truth” will shed further light. One simple answer, though, is at 27, with nearly four years inside and a lifetime to go, Hernandez’s reality had become unbearable.He was a former superstar now under constant threat of violence, petty harassment and so bottomed out that stuffing his face with honey bun after honey bun was, at times, the only option to fend off starvation.More from Yahoo Sports:• NFL ref shares unique Peyton Manning story • Warriors sweep their way to 3rd straight NBA Finals • With future unclear, Spurs star gets grand sendoff • Ducks complain about playoff schedule after loss • Lions’ repayment demand still irks Calvin Johnson",0.0
288,"Note: Continue to check out this post throughout the week as coaches continue to speak with the media and make comments on this topic.The first question posed to nearly every SEC coach this week will probably be about the transfer portal. A year into its existence, coaches continue to grapple with how best to use it, and best to assess its qualities and flaws.We’ll be running an updating post throughout the week on coaches discussing the transfer portal. Their direct quotes will be posted below their names. Coaches and ADs speak on different days with the press, so as soon as coaches speak, we will update it.Matt Luke, Ole Miss football coachQ: Why are their more transfers? Does it just feel that way because the portal makes it more public?Luke: ""I think it is maybe a little bit more, I think it’s moving in that direction with more and more transfers. And I think the portal maybe shows that and maybe promotes it just a little bit more. But I don’t see it slowing down anytime soon.Q: Do you feel waivers for transfers increasing make it more like free agency?Luke: “I liked the idea of having, when they left, to sit out a year, but when they graduate they get that year back. That way they don’t lose a year of eligibility, they get it back when they graduate. So I thought that was a unique way to look at it. If they graduate, then they could leave without penalty. But then if they didn’t, as soon as they graduated, they got that year back, so there’s no loss of a year. So I thought that was maybe something we could look at.”Will Muschamp, South Carolina football Q: Good and bad of transfer portal?Muschamp: “Regardless of what I say, nothing is gonna change. It really doesn’t matter to me, it’s here to stay, and that’s part of you as a head coach, you’ve got to manage your roster, whether it’s an undergraduate or a graduate situation. And so, I think, it hurts us, and I think a lot of coaches would agree, from a standpoint of depth on your football team — we had four guys this year who were graduate transfers, they’re all all good players, they’re all good people, they graduated, they were gonna contribute to our football team, but they felt like they wanted another opportunity somewhere else. So that’s the rules, and we support that.”Q: Feel like free agency, heading in that direction?Muschamp: “I certainly do, but again, it’s here to stay, so it’s not gonna change, I just don’t think anything is gonna change, as far as that’s concerned.”Q: What steps do you take to alleviate concerns?Muschamp: ""Guy either wants to be at South Carolina or he doesn’t. If he doesn’t want to go to South Carolina, he needs to go somewhere else. I want guys that want to be in our program, and if they don’t want to be, they can go somewhere else. I totally support.Q: Do you realign staff to monitor it?Muschamp: ... The numbers are kind of staggering. The number of names that have gone in. The number of players that have landed Power 5, the number of players that have not found a home, period. About two months ago, somebody gave me some numbers on it.Q: Do you think it’s possible it will regress with players seeing faults in it?Muschamp: ""Probably not. I think, unfortunately, in our society, the grass is always greener on the other side. And that’s not always the case.Again, when guys transfer, you hate to put a blanket statement on anything. Because every situation is different. When I was at the University of Florida, we had a young man who was from the West Coast, whose family went through a lot, and he came to me and said, ‘I love it here, I want to get closer to home because of my family situation.’ And I agreed with him, and we petitioned the NCAA for immediate eligibility, and he was granted it. And that was a good transfer. He was contributing to our team, we didn’t want to lose him, but I totally understood the situation.""Tom Crean, Georgia basketball coachQ: How often do you check the transfer portal?Crean: “A couple times a day. And again, I think you’re playing close attention to it, but if you’re consistently waiting to see who shows up in the portal, you’re behind. You’ve got to have people that have their ear to the ground. You really do. I think over the next week to two weeks, it will change even more. You’ve just got to stay really attuned to it. I don’t want to say it’s a full-time job for somebody, but it’s a team job. I mean everybody has to pay attention to where that’s at because it’s here to stay. And then I think there’s some adjustments that have to be made as we go down this line with this, because it’s not like it’s gonna slow down. Unless they put some, I don’t want to say ultimatums, but unless they put a couple more things inside of it, it’s gonna come even more. And football now is feeling it, so it’s really gonna become interesting to see what we come out of these meetings with and what the next step is there.”“For me personally, what I try to do, is as soon as we hear it, as soon we as we see it, we dive hard into the film. I try to watch as much film. I’ve got my computer down here, when I get done with this, we’ll start watching some more recruiting tape. Because you have to do it all the time, you have to have an idea, because you could screw this up too, you could take somebody that doesn’t fit you, and you’ve got to go to really look at that and see how it fits. And you’ve got to be prepared for people to leave your program.”“The best thing somebody like me can do right now, and other college coaches right now, is talk to the people in junior colleges, and say, ‘How have you been doing it?’ Because that’s where it’s at, those are the people. It’s not junior college basketball, but at the end of the day, junior college coaches are very, very comfortable recruiting year round. They’re very, very comfortable in July and August, putting their team together.”Nick Saban, Alabama football coach“How we manage our roster so we don’t penalize the players that are left in the program probably is the thing that I choose to focus on most. And having a program that is beneficial to the player, so there’s no reason for them to want to leave.”Q: Someone else called transfer portal staggering, and that many haven’t found a home. Thoughts?Saban: ""Well, we’ve always had to deal with guys that wanted to transfer. Now we just have a mechanism for them to be able to do that. And we also have an opportunity for the school to take action against that person in terms of their scholarship. You know, look, I’m for whatever benefits the player. I think that a lot of us think that we have a good program that is actually in place to try and create value for players and their future. And it’s not just about playing.“I mean you still go to college to prepare yourself for the day you can’t play football, at least that’s our philosophy. In terms of guys’ personal development, guys develop a career off the field by graduating from school. And I think there’s so much emphasis now on playing time that guys have these visions, even when they’re in high school because the attention that they get, that their college career is just a conduit to get to the NFL. And I don’t think that’s a good scenario, because you don’t go to college with the right sort of goals and aspirations.”Will Wade, LSU basketball coach, via NOLA.com“You’ve gotta be patient. Right now the supply is greater than the demand. I think there’s more kids in the transfer portal than there are Division I scholarships out there. Now obviously at our level it’s a little bit different because the filter down, there’s not as many kids that can play at this level. But I mean, you’re not going to sit here and hear me whine about the transfer portal. I don’t think it’s nearly as big of a deal as everybody makes it out to be.""I think transferring, this is my opinion, just evens out the inequities in recruiting. Usually, most of the kids that transfer from the high-major schools didn’t play a whole lot. They transferred down a level and end up playing a lot more. And so we missed on those kids in recruiting and they go to a level that’s more suitable to them. Sometimes the kids at the mid-level or lower level end up having great years and they end up transferring up a level and those were kids that the upper-level missed on and they end up where they should be. It just equals out the inequities in recruiting.”Nate Oats, Alabama basketball coach“Shoot, I helped someone like Daniel Giddens, a great kid,” Oats said. “I helped him. Some guys left on good terms and some didn’t. But that’s decisions they make as young men. Some of them were smart decisions. They’ll have better playing time elsewhere where ever they want. Diante Wood, I think will get a lot more playing time and Daniel Giddens will. Those two kept participating in workouts even after we discussed that it might be better for them to go elsewhere and they thought so to.”",0.0

292,"There is more to this story.That’s the position of the SEC’s front office regarding LSU basketball coach Will Wade as a federal trial into the corruption of college basketball begins Monday (April 22). SEC commissioner Greg Sankey agreed with LSU’s decision to suspend Wade before the SEC tournament, but Sankey remained neutral Monday when asked about the university’s decision to reinstate the controversial coach last week.“I view that as a chapter in the larger story,” Sankey said. “The suspension was part of the story, a chapter in that story. The interview and reinstatement is a chapter in that story. We have a federal trial that’s beginning today that’s related to global basketball issues. I presume that will be another chapter in that bigger story, and we’ll see how this whole story concludes.”The CliffsNotes version of this drama:Wade was suspended by LSU after refusing to speak with the school’s investigators following a report by Yahoo!Sports that Wade was caught on tape by the FBI discussing a “strong-ass offer” he allegedly made for a recruit. At the direction of his attorney, Wade met with the school on April 12 and was reinstated the following week. Wade denied any wrongdoing to investigators.“Coach Wade's explanations and clarifications offered during the meeting, absent actual evidence of misconduct, satisfy his contractual obligation to LSU,” former LSU athletic director Joe Alleva said in a statement last week.Alleva stepped down as LSU’s athletic director the following day.“LSU made a decision with the information that it now has available,” Sankey said Monday in Birmingham, speaking with members of the Associated Press Sports Editors organization. “I said at the time that I supported their decision to suspend their head men’s basketball coach when he didn’t interview. He submitted to an interview, the conference is not a part of that and they made a decision on the information available.”A leaked FBI wiretap between Wade and middleman Christian Dawkins forced LSU to suspend Wade after the Tigers won the SEC regular-season title. Wade couldn’t coach his team during the SEC or NCAA tournaments.“Dude. I went to him with a [expletive] strong-ass offer about a month ago. [Expletive] strong,” Wade reportedly said on the wiretap. “The problem was, I know why he didn’t take it now, it was [expletive] tilted toward the family a little bit. It was tilted toward taking care of the mom, taking care of the kid. Like it was tilted towards that. Now I know for a fact he didn’t explain everything to the mom. I know now, he didn’t get enough of the piece of the pie in the deal.”Sankey clarified the role of the SEC’s front office during investigations of member institutions by the NCAA.“We’re not investigators,” Sankey said. “We’re advisers.”Joseph Goodman is a columnist for the Alabama Media Group.

294,"The Denver Broncos signed Kareem Jackson to a three-year, $33 million contract in NFL free agency without having a specific position for the former Alabama standout.“That’s yet to be determined,” Broncos coach Vic Fangio said. “Once we get the team here and start working out — that’s one of his strong suits, he can play corner, safety, nickel. We’ll use him where we most need him or that best fits him.”For the Houston Texans in 2018, Jackson set a career high with 87 tackles, intercepted two passes, broke up 17 passes, caused two fumbles and recovered one. A cornerback for most of his career, Jackson started at safety, too, in 2018, and that makes him a key component in the makeover of Broncos' defensive backfield after Denver finished 6-10 and missed the playoffs for the third straight season.The Broncos’ starting secondary in 2018 featured Chris Harris and Bradley Roby at the cornerbacks and Justin Simmons and Darian Stewart at the safeties. Four-time Pro Bowler Harris and Simmons remain with the team. Roby left in free agency for a one-year, $10 million contract with the Texans after Denver signed Jackson. The Broncos released Stewart, a former Lee-Huntsville standout, halfway through a four-year, $28 million contract last week.In addition to adding Jackson, Denver signed cornerback Bryce Callahan from the Chicago Bears in free agency.“It gives us a lot of options,"" Fangio said of Jackson’s versatility. ""Just from week to week, we might be able to line him up where we feel he best fits to defend the team we’re playing. He’s smart enough to learn all the different positions. He’s proven it in games and on tape that he can execute the positions, not just know what do to do, but play them competitively and at a high level. ""It’s a big advantage, and it helps when you’re looking at other players that you have guys that can move around.”Just as he did last season for Houston, Jackson said he's up for playing multiple positions for Denver.“I actually enjoy kind of floating around, playing a little bit of everywhere,” Jackson said. “I feel like that could be an advantage for us as a team game-planning-wise, just depending on what type of skill sets that the offense possesses in terms of the guys that they have.” Fangio is entering his first season as an NFL head coach. In 2018, he served as the Chicago Bears' defensive coordinator, and the Bears gave up the fewest points in the NFL.“With the secondary, I had a chance to watch the guys in Chicago a lot this year,” Jackson said. “They played some great defense. I’m pretty good friends with (Chicago cornerback) Kyle Fuller, and (he) has said nothing but great things about Coach Vic. …“For me, just getting a chance to play with my eyes, be instinctive and react -- I don’t know a DB in this league that doesn’t want to be in these types of defenses where they can kind of see the quarterback, read, react and make some plays on the ball.”Fangio likes cornerbacks who aren’t shy about tackling. Fangio calls tackling “a strength of” Jackson’s, and the cornerback said he tries “to turn into a heat-seeking missile.”The Broncos saw that in 2018 when Jackson laid one of the hits of the year on Denver running back Phillip Lindsay in a 19-17 loss to the Texans on Nov. 4.
“I kind of pride myself on being physical, kind of imposing my will on the receivers or running backs if I get the chance” Jackson said. “I’ve always been like that. I think those things throughout the course of a game can kind of change the game. It can spark your team, or it can cause turnovers or things like that. Obviously, those things can definitely work in our favor. Throughout my career, I’ve just always been that type of guy -- kind of get down in the line and be physical and tackle.”Jackson joined the Texans as the 20th player picked in the 2010 NFL Draft. In his nine seasons, Houston won the AFC South title five times, including 2018, when the Texans ran off a nine-game winning streak after opening the season at 0-3.Jackson has made 559 tackles and 16 interceptions in his 132 NFL games. He's tied for the franchise lead for career interceptions. But Jackson said the Texans didn't try to keep him after nine seasons with the team. “They didn’t even approach me with an offer or any type of deal,” Jackson said. ""Obviously, they didn’t want me back or whatever the case may be. I’m not really sure. My agent was never approached by anybody from the Texans organization, so I wasn’t offered a deal of any sort. I kind of feel a little disrespected, to be honest about it. …""I'm not emotional. I know how the business goes. All good things sometimes come to an end. At the end of the day, it's another opportunity for me. They've got a great group of guys (in Denver). I'm eager to get there and do whatever I can to help them win.""FOR MORE OF AL.COM’S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGEMark Inabinett is a sports reporter for Alabama Media Group.

303,"The SEC released its findings on the bench-clearing brawl during Thursday’s Mississippi State-Ole Miss game, admitting that some of the wrong players were ejected.According to the SEC release, Ole Miss wide receiver A.J. Brown and quarterback Matt Corral and Mississippi State safety Jonathan Abram and cornerback Jamal Peters should have been ejected for “flagrant personal fouls.” Mississippi State’s Cameron Dantzler and Ole Miss’ C.J. Moore were ejected in error, the league ruled.Peters was ejected after ripping Corral’s helmet off. Referees gave an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty to every player on both teams, which resulted in Mississippi State linebacker Willie Gay Jr. being ejected because it was his second such penalty.The fisticuffs began at the end of the third quarter, when Brown scored an apparent touchdown with Mississippi State leading 28-3 (the Bulldogs won the game 35-3). Abram escalated matters when he slapped Brown in the helmet, several players began pushing and shoving and Peters and Corral eventually tangled.According to the SEC release, the four players — Brown, Corral, Abram and Peters — have been publicly reprimanded. They will not face further suspension for being ejected, but might be for any “future similar actions.”After the game, Mississippi State players celebrated at midfield with the Golden Egg trophy and some tried to plant their school flag on the Ole Miss logo. Ole Miss deputy athletic director Michael Thompson apparently took offense, which led to another confrontation between the two sides.According to one report, Ole Miss athletics director Ross Bjork and Mississippi State AD John Cohen exchanged words after the game. SEC commissioner Greg Sankey released the following statement:""It remains disappointing to have seen the unnecessary actions during and after the Mississippi State at Ole Miss game on Thursday night. These actions are unacceptable and my concern relates to the bigger issue of the repeated incidents before, during and after games between these football programs. These incidents have become too common in this series. I will require both athletics directors to meet with me at the SEC Office in the off-season to review past issues and develop a plan for the purpose of creating a healthier environment for this annual game.""The Ole Miss-Mississippi State rivalry has always been a heated one, but it has gone to another level since the NCAA began investigation the Rebels for recruiting violations and improper benefits that occurred under former coaches Houston Nutt and Hugh Freeze.

The release request came in a fit of pique from Brown about his latest fine, over an outburst at Mayock during practice.

313,"Two more AAF players with Alabama football roots are headed for the NFL. The Carolina Panthers announced on Monday that they’d signed offensive tackle Brandon Greene and defensive tackle T.J. Barnes to one-year contracts.Greene, an Alabama alumnus, played for the Birmingham Iron and Barnes, a former Enterprise High School standout, played for the Atlanta Legends in 2018 before the Alliance of American Football halted its season last week.Greene joined the Crimson Tide as an offensive lineman, but he switched to tight end before his redshirt-freshman season. As a sophomore, Greene moved to offensive tackle, but shifted back to tight end before the end of the season and caught a 24-yard pass in overtime against LSU. In 2015, Greene saw action as a tight end and an interior lineman. As a senior, Greene worked as a tight end, mainly as an extra blocker and in jumbo packages, but he did catch one pass.Greene went to training camp with the NFL's Chicago Bears in 2017, working mainly as a guard. The Bears released Greene as they reduced their roster from the preseason limit of 90 players to the regular-season maximum of 53.But Chicago picked up Greene for its practice squad, and he stayed there until the Bears brought him up to the active roster with two games left in the regular season. However, he didn't get on the field in either remaining contest.Greene was back in training camp with the Bears last year, but again he was released at the end of the preseason.Barnes has 21 games of NFL experience, although he hasn't played in the league since 2016.After Enterprise, Barnes played his college football at Georgia Tech. He went to training camp with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2013 as an undrafted rookie and spent part of that season with the New York Jets.Barnes made his NFL debut with six games for the Jets in 2014. In 2015, he played in six games with the Jets and four with the Buffalo Bills. In 2016, Barnes played in five games with the Kansas City Chiefs.

317,"Suspended LSU basketball coach Will Wade on Thursday released a statement asking that the school reinstate him, a day before the Tigers are due to play their first game in the SEC tournament.In a statement released to media, Wade argued that he acted on advice of counsel by not meeting with school officials regarding published comments by Wade from a 2017 FBI wiretap. Refusing to meet with LSU president F. King Alexander and athletics director Joe Alleva led to Wade's suspension last Friday.On the FBI wiretap, a transcript of which was published in partial form by Yahoo Sports and ESPN last Thursday, Wade discussed a ""deal"" — apparently financial in nature — he had made through a third party with then-recruit Javonte Smart, now a freshman guard for the Tigers. Smart was also held out of last Saturday's regular-season finale against Vanderbilt while the school continues to investigate the matter.Without Wade and Smart, the Tigers beat Vanderbilt 80-59 to secure a share of the SEC regular-season championship and the No. 1 seed for the conference tournament. At various points during the game, fans chanted ""Free Will Wade,"" held up homemade signs in support of the suspended coach and booed Alleva.LSU (26-5) faces the winner of Thursday's game between Florida and Arkansas in a quarterfinal game on Friday. It's unclear if Smart will be reinstated by then, though interim coach Tony Benford said Tuesday he hoped the Tigers' fourth-leading scorer (who averages 11.5 points per game) would be cleared to play soon.The full text of Wade's statement, via NOLA.com:""This morning, I advised President Alexander, Athletic Director Joe Alleva and the LSU Board of Supervisors that I would like to resume my duties as Head Basketball Coach. Last week, when the University decided to place me on administrative leave, I accepted the decision without complaint as I knew that they wanted time to reflect on the flurry of media reports. With the benefit of a week to consider the circumstances, I believe University officials should allow me to resume my duties.""I understand that in today’s hyper-intense media environment it is extremely difficult for any organization, particularly a public university, to stand firm in the face of rumors, leaks and innuendo. In this case, the simple truth is I have been placed on leave because I exercised my right not to submit to a joint LSU/NCAA interview on the exact same subject matter at issue in an impending federal criminal trial in New York. My legal counsel advised the University that it would be wholly inappropriate for me, or anyone, to submit to an interview under these circumstances.“Declining to be interviewed was a difficult decision for me, as I would like to cooperate fully with all parties, particularly LSU. To be clear, however, all I’ve done is follow the prudent advice of counsel to exercise my constitutional rights to due process. Given these facts, I don’t believe it is appropriate for me to be relieved of my duties. We have a great basketball program made up of excellent student athletes and quality coaches. The players who’ve given their all for this institution, the students and alumni who are devoted to LSU, and fans all across Louisiana and beyond deserve to see this team fulfill its destiny. I love LSU and everything it stands for. What I’m asking for is the right to do my job while exercising my constitutional rights. I don’t think that’s too much to ask.”",0.0

324,"Highly touted quarterback Justin Fields has notified Georgia he intends to transfer, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports.The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because the school has not yet acknowledged the transfer.Fields, who backed up Jake Fromm this season, was the No. 2 overall recruit in the country just a year ago in the Rivals.com rankings. Fields’ arrival at Georgia came with immediate questions about how he would fit in the program, as Fromm had quarterbacked the Bulldogs to the national title game as a true freshman.As it turned out, Georgia never found a consistent role for Fields, who completed 27 of 39 passes for 328 yards and four touchdowns and had 42 rushing attempts for 266 yards.His most memorable play of the season came when he was supposed to run a fake punt against Alabama late in the SEC championship game with the score tied, a play that failed and ultimately paved the way for Alabama’s game-winning touchdown.Though Fields showed a few flashes of his talent, they came mostly in blowout games and it wasn’t clear that he had a path to more playing time next season with Fromm returning for his junior season in 2019.Fields was also the subject of racially bigoted comments made by a Georgia baseball player during a Sept. 29 win against Tennessee, which led to that player’s dismissal from the program after an internal investigation.Fields, from Kennesaw, Ga., just outside of Atlanta, arguably will be the most highly coveted transfer in all of college football. He is expected to appeal to the NCAA to be eligible this season.A message left with the Georgia athletics department was not immediately returned. ",0.0
326,"Wild Card Weekend saw all four home teams bounced from the playoffs, so it's only fitting that all four home teams this weekend are favored.Does Wild Card Weekend ever disappoint? We had a cold weather game, a dirty game, a vintage Aaron Rodgers performance, one of the most heartbreaking missed field goals you'll ever see, and a game in which a quarterback threw four interceptions and lost a fumble and still wasn't benched.Football is the best.Without further ado, here are my picks for the divisional round of the playoffs. Let's hope these games as fun as last weekend's.Tom Brady(Christian Petersen/Getty Images) The NFL needs to start testing for synthetic marijuana so that players will stop using it in lieu of the non-synthetic stuff. Chandler Jones' bugged-out antics, which included reportedly showing up to the police station on his own with his shirt off and voluntarily getting on his knees with his hands behind his back, led to Cris Carter to wonder on Mike & Mike if Jones was actually smoking PCP.Now, I have no idea what Jones did or didn't do, but it's generally a bad look for everyone involved (Jones, Carter, the Patriots, the NFL) when PCP is casually being floated around as an explanation for something. Especially during the playoffs!Anyway, I think Kansas City manages to keep things close in New England, but assuming Edelman and Gronk are healthy for the Pats, the Chiefs aren't winning. Still, K.C. has a stingy defensive front that should make things interesting against a wonky Pats o-line. Not to mention that a team riding an 11-game win streak is scary, even if these wins didn't come against great teams, and even for Bill Belichick.Ultimately, though, Tom Brady is Tom Brady and he's 8-1 after a playoff bye. That's not changing this weekend, though don't expect the Patriots to do to the Chiefs what the Chiefs did to the Texans.The pick: Patriots 27, Chiefs 23Story continuesAaron Rodgers(Al Bello/Getty Images) Aaron Rodgers and the Packers looked great last weekend, sure, but remember the last time these two teams played in Arizona? The Cardinals barely needed to use their offense and still cruised to a 38-8 win.The Packers obviously have some restored confidence after their road win last weekend, and the playoffs inevitably means closer games. If there's a quarterback you'd want in this situation, it's Rodgers. But the Cardinals just seem to be the all-around better team, they're coming off a bye, and I just won't ever bet against Bruce Arians, so long as he keeps wearing his suede Kangol.The pick: Cardinals 30, Packers 21Michael Bennett(Rob Carr/Getty) You have to be more than a little upset if you're a Panthers fan, right? A 15-1 regular season record gets you home field advantage and ... the Seahawks?Luckily for Carolina, this is a particularly mercurial Seattle squad that needed some Russell Wilson black magic, a timely Adrian Peterson fumble, and a miracle missed field goal to beat Minnesota. There are plenty of big brother/little brother narratives that you should expect to hear FOX tell you all about (Russell Wilson/Cam Newton; Richard Sherman/Josh Norman) and these two teams have plenty of history. This is one of those rare instances where both teams will think of as a revenge game: Seattle because they blew a 4th quarter lead against Carolina earlier this season, and Carolina because the Seahawks bounced them from the playoffs last year.Ultimately I think Marshawn Lynch will be the x-factor here. If he's healthy, he makes Seattle's offense really scary. I want to pick at least one underdog this weekend, and while it feels like a cop out to pick Seattle — the team everyone's picking — I like them too much to bet against. Sorry, Cam.The pick: Seahawks 27, Panthers 24Pittsburgh Steelers (+7) @ Denver BroncosPeyton Manning(Doug Pensinger/Getty) The Broncos should make sure to send Vontaze Burfict a thank-you note after this one. A hobbled Roethlisberger will be without Antonio Brown, Le'Veon Bell, and DeAngelo Williams in this one. Aside from Williams, Burfict is to thank for all these injuries.Which is a bummer, because these two teams played one of the best games of the regular season. I don't think this one will be nearly as close, but Peyton Manning could throw five interceptions.

329,"DEAUVILLE, France -- A loss at the World Cup isn’t always what it seems.The Americans are already through to the next round, lessening some of the importance of Thursday’s final Group F game against Sweden. Yes, there’s still top of the group to be determined, to say nothing of that not-so-insignificant grudge they’ve been carrying around for almost three years now after Sweden handed them their earliest exit from a major international tournament. But truth be told, the U.S. might be better off sandbagging it against Sweden. A loss now might actually improve their chances of winning the tournament.“We want to win every game,” U.S. coach Jill Ellis said. “That’s where we’re at, and that’s what we want to do.”Ellis’ response hardly comes as a surprise. One of the U.S. women’s best attributes has always been their determination, and they have shown so far this tournament that they have no interest in dialing it back or toning it down.But is it the best play?Which road to take is more than an existential question at the World Cup. Where you finish in the group determines your path through the knockout rounds, and sometimes the draw does the winners no favors.The winners of Groups A and D at this World Cup are on the same side of the draw as the Group F winner. That means, should the U.S. finish atop Group F, it faces the prospect of having to play France (quarterfinals) and England (semifinals) just to get to the final. France is ranked No. 4 in the world but has been arguably the strongest team in the tournament after the Americans, and it also can count on a sizable home-crowd advantage. England, ranked No. 3, finished third four years ago.Should the Americans lose to Sweden, however, it would likely mean playing Germany in the quarterfinals. Yes, Germany is ranked No. 2 in the world, a two-time World Cup winner and the reigning Olympic champion.But it has looked vulnerable, by far the weakest of the top teams.“You can’t overthink this,” Ellis insisted. “Deciding to come second or manipulate a score, I just think that can be dangerous.”It might not end up mattering, anyway.There was no shortage of angst when Belgium and England faced off in the men’s World Cup last summer with the top spot in their group on the line, the fear being the winner was putting itself on a collision course with either Brazil or Mexico in the quarterfinals.“We want to perform well but the priority is not to win,"" Belgium manager Roberto Martinez acknowledged before the game.Belgium beat England to win the group and, sure enough, got Brazil in the quarterfinals. But the Red Devils beat Brazil, ensuring they would either match or better their previous best finish, fourth, at a World Cup.Belgium lost to eventual winner France in the semis while England lost to Croatia. The Red Devils then beat England, again, in the third-place game.And in the 2011 Women's World Cup, the United States finished second to Sweden in group play, which meant playing Brazil rather than Australia in the quarterfinals. The Americans won – in epic fashion, no less – and would go on to reach the finals.“Whether you play team X in group play, whether you play in the semis or finals or quarters or 16s, you’ve got to play everybody -- and you’ve got to be prepared to play everybody to win this thing,” Ellis said.“I don’t think there’s a plotting out a dream path or something like that. The draw is what it is, and we navigate whoever’s in front of us.”Besides, unlike most of the rest of us, who would need little encouragement to take it easy at work, telling the Americans to play to lose would likely spark a rebellion.After that 13-0 rout of Thailand in the opener, Ellis made seven changes to her starting lineup for Sunday’s game against Chile. The Americans still won 3-0 – and would have scored six or seven more had Chilean goalkeeper Christiane Endler not been downright spectacular, a performance that will be hard for any goalkeeper to top the rest of the tournament.She stopped 14 shots just in the second half, repeatedly stymieing Christen Press and making a kick save on a point-blank shot from Lindsey Horan.So to ask the Americans to not go full throttle against Sweden, yeah, that probably won’t happen.“I struggle to tell my team not to tackle each other in training the day before” a game, Ellis said.The U.S. women have been called a lot of things already at this World Cup.

330,"STUTTGART, Germany -- Competing at a world championships is nerve-wracking, especially for the first time, and Sunisa Lee has had no shortage of people giving her encouragement.Her teammates. The U.S. coaches. National team director Tom Forster.The biggest boost, though, came from someone thousands of miles away.“(My Dad) FaceTimed me before the meet, and he was giving me a pep talk. He was super excited,” Lee said Saturday night, after she finished second only to Simone Biles in qualifying at the world gymnastics championships.“He’s doing a lot better,” she added. “He should also be going home maybe next week.”Balance is as vital to gymnasts as the air they breathe. It’s what allows them to do skills that defy physics and the ordinary person’s imagination. It also can mean the difference between standing on a podium or sprawling across the floor.For Lee, however, balance has taken on a different, weightier meaning in the last two months.On Aug. 4, Lee’s father, Houa John, fell off a ladder while he was helping a friend trim a tree. The accident injured his spinal cord, paralyzing him from the chest down initially. John Lee also broke his right wrist and fractured several ribs.  The accident occurred just before Sunisa Lee was to leave for the national championships in Kansas City. With her head in Kansas City and her heart back home in St. Paul, Minnesota, Lee went ahead and competed, finishing second to Biles in the all-around and establishing herself as a medal contender for next year’s Tokyo Olympics.Lee was eager to return home after nationals and spend time with her father and family. But with the world championships less than two months away, and knowing the pride and joy her gymnastics has brought her dad, there was no time to take off from training.So she juggled her workouts with visits to her father, who remains at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, while also helping her mother care for her five siblings. There was school, too, since Lee just started her junior year in high school.“It’s been really hard,” Lee acknowledged. “I’ve had to sacrifice a lot of things so I can go see my Dad and getting training in as well and starting school and stuff like that. So it was hard to get the schedule worked out because there’s been so many things happening.”  The composure Lee has shown so far at worlds gives little hint of her personal turmoil or the growing expectations on her.Despite a fall on balance beam, she posted the second-highest individual score in qualifying, a 57.166. She and teammate Jade Carey tied for second on floor exercise, but Lee got the tiebreak – and the spot in the event final – because her execution score was four-tenths higher than Carey’s.But it was on uneven bars that Lee truly shined.She appears almost weightless as she floats between bars, one skill flowing seamlessly into another. Most impressive was that she continuously alternated between the high and low bars, doing only one skill before switching to the other bar. Few gymnasts can manage that because it requires an inordinate amount of control and focus, and Lee’s difficulty score of 6.4 reflects the challenge of doing all of these skills back to back.If she loses her rhythm, there is no cover. If she gets off-balance, there is no time to reset.Lee’s score of 15.0 was third-highest on uneven bars. The gymnasts ahead of her, Nina Derwael and Daria Spiridonova, are both world champions on the event.“Pretty cool, huh?” Forster said.“She’s fit in really well with the other girls,” he added of Lee, the only world championships rookie on the U.S. team. “They’ve taken her under their wing … (and) the morale with her on the team has been really up and positive. So it’s been fun to see how she fits in.“And, of course, her gymnastics are beautiful.”It's not easy, balancing life's highest highs and lowest lows. But Lee and her family are managing. Lee said her father remains paralyzed from the waist down, but “everything else is healing pretty well.” He has already vowed that if Lee makes the Olympic team, he’ll be there in Tokyo to cheer his daughter on.After everything that’s happened these last two months, having John Lee deliver his pep talk in person would be the ultimate prize, more precious even than gold. Follow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour. ",0.0

333,"Zion Williamson doesn’t belong in college.With every game he plays, every opponent he dismantles, every did-you-see-THAT highlight he produces, the Duke freshman shows why the NBA needs to scrap its ridiculous “one-and-done” rule. Three games into his college career, it’s clear Williamson is more ready for the NBA than some of the guys already there.Look, going straight to the NBA from high school isn’t right for every player. In fact, it’s probably not the right move for most.As dominant as they were in high school or on the AAU circuit, the NBA is a different world and the year or two players spend in college – maybe even three or four – could make the difference between having a long, successful career and joining the list of phenom flameouts. Some need the coaching and competition they’ll get in college, while others need to get stronger.  More:Former LSU assistant coach offered Duke's Zion Williamson a football scholarshipMore:Shaky win over Southern Illinois leaves No. 2 Kentucky with even more questions to answerBut there are some players with the maturity, on the court and off, to go directly to the NBA, and the league’s insistence on a one-year moratorium to their entry hasn’t done anyone any good. Not a league whose popularity revolves around transcendent players. Not a college game where the competition is so wildly lopsided.And not a player like Williamson, who might be the guy to carry the NBA in the post-LeBron world.In his first three games at Duke, Williamson is averaging a double-double with 25.3 points and 10.7 rebounds, and he’s shooting 82%. Yes, you read that right. Williamson is shooting 82% from the floor.He’s doing this despite limited playing time. Against Eastern Michigan on Wednesday night, he scored 21 points, grabbed nine rebounds and had a jaw-dropping dunk in all of 21 minutes.Against then-No. 2 Kentucky last week, he was on the floor for just 23 minutes yet scored 28 on 11-of-13 shooting and had seven rebounds.“Oh, he was good today. Whoo,” Kentucky coach John Calipari said after the game, a 118-84 win for Duke. “He got some shots off on big guys that were trying to block it. I thought that would bother him and it absolutely did not bother him today.“We had a 7-footer in there and a 6-11 (guy), and he drove right at them,” Calipari added. “I’m like, holy cow.”But Williamson is big, too. As in football player-size big. Whether he’s the 285 pounds he’s listed at or the 270 pounds coach Mike Krzyzewski said is his playing weight, it should come as no surprise that a former LSU assistant once offered Williamson a football scholarship.What makes Williamson so dazzling, however, is that he doesn’t play like a traditional big man. Sure, he dunks and rebounds and protects the paint as if he’s a guard dog. But he has a sweet shooting stroke – you don’t get to 82 percent if all you’re doing is chucking it – and is deceptively agile.“More so than how high he jumps is his incredible body control, especially on a fast break,” Krzyzewski said. “You would not think slither is a word you would ever use with him and basically he does that. Which is crazy.”No, what’s crazy is that Williamson was barred from the NBA this year because of an arbitrary rule. While perhaps well-intentioned at the time it was implemented, “one-and-done” no longer makes sense. Not when athletes in other sports are turning pro as teenagers, and entrepreneurs are dropping out of school to jump-start their careers.If someone has the talent to make it in their chosen profession, the age at which they do it is irrelevant.Besides, the NBA now has a developmental league that provides a fallback for guys who don’t want to go to school but aren’t quite ready for the league.NBA Commissioner Adam Silver acknowledged over the summer that “one and done” is soon to just be done, saying the league was “ready” to make a change. But it has to be negotiated with the union as part of the collective bargaining agreement, making it unlikely to happen before the 2021 draft. That's just silly.When someone makes the college game look like child's play, as Williamson is doing, he belongs in the NBA.

335,"The Canadian PressTOKYO (AP) — Japan’s Asahi Shimbun newspaper on Wednesday called for the Tokyo Olympics to be canceled with the games set to open in less than two months. It is the first of Japan’s major newspapers to make the move and joins some regional newspapers that have recently added to the growing opposition to holding the Olympics. Coming out against the Olympics could be significant since the newspaper, like many in Japan, is a sponsor of the postponed Tokyo Games that are scheduled to open on July 23. Asahi is typically liberal-leaning and often opposes the ruling party led by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. “We cannot think it’s rational to host the Olympics in the city this summer,” the newspaper said in its editorial under a headline that read: “We Demand PM Suga Decide Cancellation."" “Distrust and backlash against the reckless national government, Tokyo government and stakeholders in the Olympics are nothing but escalating,” the editorial added. ""We demand Prime Minister Suga to calmly evaluate the circumstances and decide the cancellation of the summer event.” Asahi has a morning circulation reported at 5.16 million, and 1.55 million for its evening edition. It is second in circulation behind Yomiuri Shimbun, and subsequently is the second largest circulating newspaper in the world behind Yomiuri. Despite the editorial, there is no indication the International Olympic Committee or local organizers have any plans to pull the plug on the games. But opposition is mounting with only a tiny percentage of Japanese people now vaccinated. Tokyo organizing committee CEO Toshiro Muto said Wednesday he was aware of the editorial, but offered little response. Asahi is one of about 70 local Olympic sponsors that have chipped in almost $3.5 billion to the organizing committee budget. It is also one of a half dozen newspapers that are sponsors. “Of course, different press organizations have different views. And that’s very natural,"" Muto said, adding local partners, or sponsors, continued to offer “support.” Senior IOC member Richard Pound said in an interview with Japan’s JiJi Press last week that the final deadline to call off the Olympics was still a month away. “Before the end of June, you really need to know, yes or no,” JiJi quoted Pound as saying. The British Medical Journal called last month for a hard look at going forward with the Olympics. Local medical officials have also been skeptical, and billionaire businessman Masayoshi Son suggested over the weekend that the IOC was forcing the Olympics on Japan. ""Right now, more than 80% of the nation’s people want the Olympics postponed or canceled,” said Son, the founder and CEO of SoftBank Group Corp. who also owns the SoftBank Hawks baseball team. “Who is forcing this to go ahead, and under what rights?” Son added. Asahi also criticized the IOC, calling it “self-righteous” and also lambasted IOC vice president John Coates. Last week, Coates was asked if the Olympics would be held if a state of emergency were in force. “Absolutely, yes,” he replied. The newspaper said there was a “huge gap” between Coates' words and the sentiments “of the people.” “Despite its overgrown size and excessive commercialism and many other problems, the Olympics have been supported because of empathy for its ideals. ... But what is the reality now?” Asahi asked. On Tuesday, the Japanese government said a warning by the United States to avoid travel to Japan would have no impact on holding the Olympics. Japan has officially spent $15.4 billion to organize the Olympics, and government audits suggest it might be much larger. The IOC gets billions from selling broadcast rights, which amounts to about 75% of its income. Public opinion polls in Japan show between 60-80% want the Olympics canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and an online petition asking the games be canceled has gained 400,000 signatures in a few weeks. Tokyo, Osaka and other regions of the country are under a state of emergency that is likely to be extended past its May 31 expiration. Organizers and the IOC, often citing the authority of the World Health Organization, say the games can be held safely with 15,000 Olympic and Paralympic athletes entering Japan, joined by tens of thousands of judges, officials, sponsors, broadcasters and media. Fans from abroad have already been banned, and organizers are to announce next month if any fans at all will be allowed into Olympic venues. ___ Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi contributed to this report. ___ More AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/olympic-games and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Stephen Wade And Kantaro Komiya, The Associated Press",0.0

339,"The TelegraphTwo of the surprise packages of this clay-court season have been British – initially Dan Evans, who made a deep run in Monte Carlo, and more lately Cameron Norrie, who played his second final in three weeks on Sunday. Unfortunately, Norrie wasn’t able to land a maiden ATP title in Lyon. But then he was up against Stefanos Tsitsipas, who has been the dominant force of 2021 outside the slams, and now stands at No 1 in the table of most rankings points gained since January 1. Nevertheless, it had been a hugely creditable effort for Norrie to go this far, especially when you consider that he took out top seed Dominic Thiem on Thursday, and then trounced big-hitting Russian Karen Khachanov in Saturday’s semi-final, losing only two games in the process. Norrie has come to clay late in his career, but it feels like this is developing into his favourite surface. He has one of the heaviest left-handed forehands in the game, loaded with top-spin, and uses it like a miniature version of Rafael Nadal. The result has been a tally of 14 wins and only four losses since he began his European clay-court swing in Barcelona. So while the French Open, which starts next Sunday, has traditionally been a graveyard of British hopes, there are reasons to hope that this year’s event could deliver some more positive results. Norrie’s previous final in Estoril had been a nervewracking affair which he eventually lost on a deciding-set tie-break to the more experienced Spaniard Albert Ramos-Vinolas. Sunday was more straightforward for Tsitsipas, who needed only 69 minutes to hammer home a 6-3, 6-3 victory. It was Tsitsipas’ second title of the clay-court sequence, after he won Monte Carlo in mid-April, taking out Evans in the semi-final along the way. He has become a serious contender to upset the establishment – specifically Nadal and Novak Djokovic – at Roland Garros over the next few weeks. “I felt in good shape from the beginning of the tournament,” said Tsitsipas afterwards. “I am proud of today’s match, I knew it would be a difficult one against Cameron, who has been showing great tennis this week. He has been winning against good players and showing what the left hand can do on clay. “It was not an easy match today. I had to handle the nerves and I am proud of my performance and the way I stayed focused towards my goal.” On this year’s results, meanwhile, both Evans and Norrie stand among the world’s 20 most successful men. Evans is at No 16 and Norrie No 14. The next challenge for them both is to convert that ATP Tour form into a deep run at a major.",0.0
341,"OAKLAND, Calif. — The Alameda County Sheriff’s Office confirmed Friday morning it is pursuing a misdemeanor complaint against Toronto Raptors president Masai Ujiri for battery of a police officer after an altercation following Game 6 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night, a spokesman for the department told USA TODAY Sports. Ujiri is accused of twice shoving an officer and striking him in the face after he was stopped from coming onto the court to join the Raptors’ postgame celebration at the Golden State Warriors' Oracle Arena because he did not display a proper credential, according to police. Video of the aftermath of that incident was captured by NBC Bay Area, which was the first to report the complaint against Ujiri. Ujiri appears to be holding a credential in his right hand in the video, and he also appears to be holding a credential in the same hand in a video that shows him watching the end of the game from the tunnel — before the incident occurred. However, per NBA rules, only personnel with specially designated gold armbands were allowed on the court after the conclusion of the game, and it's unclear if Ujiri was wearing one or had one in his possession.“We were told to strictly enforce the credentialing policy and not allow anyone onto the court without a credential, so our deputies were doing that,” Sgt. Ray Kelly, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office, said. “Our deputy contacted Mr. Masai Ujiri as he attempted to walk onto the court. He had no credential displayed, and our deputy asked for his credential.“Mr. Ujiri didn’t produce them and pushed our deputy out of the way to gain access to the court. At that point our deputy tried to stop him and pushed him backward and then Mr. Ujiri came back with a second shove, a more significant push that, with his forward momentum, his arm struck our deputy in the face.“At that point our deputy pushed Mr. Ujiri away again and some NBA security people and others intervened and he ended up walking onto the court.”Kelly declined to name the officer and said the police chose not to detain Ujiri on the court because it wouldn’t have been in “anyone’s best interests” to do that on national television, as the Raptors were preparing for the postgame trophy ceremony. “We decided to take the high road in light of their victory but will submit a report for complaint,” Kelly said. It will be up to the district attorney whether charges are brought against Ujiri. MORE COVERAGE:Catch up on everything surrounding the wild ending to the NBA FinalsGreg Wiener, a Warriors season-ticket holder who says he was at the game with his son and was about ""three inches away"" from the officer during the incident, told USA TODAY Sports on Friday afternoon that the police's account is ""not entirely true.""""(Ujiri) had (his credential) in his hand and his hand was down by his side,"" he said. ""It looked like he was trying to get it up. As Ujiri came forward, the cop stepped forward and put his hand on his chest and basically said, 'Nobody can go past this point.' He just stopped him. Ujiri didn't say anything, he didn't get his badge up, then the cop kind of pushed him back, then Ujiri shoved him. I mean, hard."" ... The thing that I'm pushing back on is where they're saying that the cop asked for his credentials. Yeah, he didn't ask. ... There was no conversation at all.""Wiener, who has been going to Warriors games for ""about 45 years,"" added that he ""didn't see"" Ujiri strike the officer in the face and said ""the cop initiated the contact, no doubt about it.""The Raptors said in a statement to The Associated Press that the team is cooperating with authorities and looking into the incident. NBA spokesman Mike Bass said that the league is in contact with the Raptors and police and is in the process of gathering more information.Ujiri, 48, has been president of the Raptors for six seasons, and he has been instrumental in helping bring Toronto its first title in franchise history while overseeing all facets of basketball operations. ESPN reported after the game that the Washington Wizards are preparing to offer Ujiri, who has two years remaining on his contract with the Raptors, a lucrative deal to run the team's basketball operations while also giving him the opportunity for ownership equity.Ujiri previously worked with the Denver Nuggets, where he was named 2012-13 NBA Executive of the Year.

354,"OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Not until Nate McMillan began being fitted for custom-made suits a few years into his NBA career three decades ago did he understand just how far his arms reached.When Bill Walton dominated at UCLA in the 1970s, no one ever measured his wingspan — from fingertips to fingertips and arms outstretched.Neither knew their wingspans then, and they still don't. That is not the case for young players.""Yeah, I found that out once I bought my first suit,"" the 6-foot-5 McMillan, a 12-year pro now coaching the Pacers, said with a chuckle, realizing his arms stretched more than 3 feet each.Once limited to descriptions of birds, wingspan has become one of the most important measurements for basketball prospects over the past decade. Coaches marvel at players with long arms, figuring they will more easily grab rebounds, block shots, steal passes and shoot over defenders.The average man has a wingspan about 2 inches more than his height. But several NBA players pop off the chart because of their long arms.It's no coincidence that Jazz center Rudy Gobert, who stands 7-1 and led the NBA in blocks last season, has the longest wingspan in the league at 7 feet, 9 inches.The NBA playoffs begin Saturday, and an extra inch of reach can lead to a blocked shot or steal that might alter a series or a season.Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo is nicknamed the ""Greek Freak"" in part because he stands 6-11 with a 7-3 wingspan and giant hands. The explosive Russell Westbrook is 6-3, with a wingspan of 6-8, which helps him be one of the best rebounding guards in history.""Every asset that a player has might make up for something else. If somebody's short, hopefully they're quick. The wingspan sure helps a lot of people,"" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said . ""You look at size of hands, wingspans. Look at John Stockton's arms or Avery Johnson's arms and they're very long, and their hands are very big. They can control the basketball, they can do things with it.""A wingspan always helps people, whether it's blocking shots or deflections on defense.""In recent seasons, Warriors high-scoring All-Star Kevin Durant has become more determined to use his 7-5 wingspan to make more of an impact on defense.Durant, the reigning NBA Finals MVP , is quick to point out that his length allows him to make up for other areas, including being far leaner than most NBA players.""You make up a lot of ground. I'm not as fast laterally, I'm not as athletic, I'm not as quick as guys up and down but I think I make up for it with my length,"" said Durant, a defensive player of the year candidate. ""There's a lot of guys, Draymond (Green) is the same way, small, undersized power forward but can guard plenty of guys because of his length. His arms are long and he can block shots. We've seen him block guys at the rim and also get his hands on some basketballs off the dribble.""Raised in France, Gobert kept growing from ages 15-19. He didn't often hear the term wingspan, finally understanding how special his measurement is when he got to the NBA.""I think it's something that makes a big difference, especially defensively,"" he said. ""You're able to deflect the pass or block shots.""Warriors 7-foot center JaVale McGee went through only a handful of pre-draft workouts for NBA teams, hardly a prized prospect after a career at Nevada. Yet each visit he made, among the first things measured was his wingspan, 7-6.One of the benefits is his ability to corral and slam home lob passes that are high and might be off target. Before he got to the NBA, McGee wasn't even aware of his wingspan.""I've always been tall. I was born tall,"" he said. ""It's nothing that I heard about until I got to the league, or right before I got into the league, they're like, 'We'd like to measure your wingspan.' They don't really bring it up to us about that in college or high school.""Walton is in the Hall of Fame, but he never had his arms measured end to end.""At one time, they were long enough, and I can still put my own shoes and socks on,"" he quipped. ""It's not how big you are, it's how big you play. Any time you think you're too small to make a difference in the world you've never spent the night alone in bed with a mosquito. But when you have the great game of basketball with all the ultimate winners of the genetic lottery ... it's not how high you jump, it's where you are and when you jump.""Wingspan is one detail Warriors coach Steve Kerr takes seriously and might consider when deciding on lineups and rotations for the defending champions. He has been going with a center by committee based on matchups.Some of the best players Kerr faced had incredible reach.""It's legit. It's much more important than your height,"" Kerr said. ""If your wingspan is more than your height, that's kind of abnormal. Most of us have the same wingspan as our height. That's kind of a rule of thumb. A lot of basketball players don't, though, they have wider wingspans. And they're able to get their hands on balls or shots or loose balls. ... I'm a big believer in that.""___More AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball",0.0
355,"ATLANTA — Robert Alford isn’t ashamed to admit it.That was definitely a flop by Alford, the Atlanta Falcons cornerback, after Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers pulled Alford’s helmet off at the end of a scramble in Sunday’s NFC Championship Game and then threw a little elbow on his way back to the field.“Oh yes,” Alford said, grinning after the Falcons’ 44-21 romp sent them on to Super Bowl LI. “I tried to get another penalty up on him.”Falcons give Georgia Dome fitting finale with NFC Championship Game winRodgers was one of several Packers to get in Alford’s face after an earlier hit on the Packers star that officials initially flagged, only to reverse themselves because they ruled Rodgers didn’t slide.And Alford didn’t seem overly impressed by Rodgers’ rough day, on which the superstar had several heated exchanges with officials over flags he thought should’ve been thrown and was penalized himself for the play that left Alford helmet-less and trust-falling into an official on the sideline.“You seen him snatch my helmet off,” Alford said. “That’s not Aaron Rodgers-like type plays. I mean, he’s a great quarterback. For him to do that, I’m speechless with that one.”Were the Falcons in Rodgers’ head?“I really don’t know. I’ll leave it up to y’all to decide,” Alford said. “I’ve never seen Aaron Rodgers do the things, some of the things, that he’s done. But I think we probably rattled him a little bit.”Aaron Rodgers: Packers need to 'reload,' not rebuildRodgers finished 27-of-45 passing for 287 yards and three touchdowns with one interception on a day he was far from Green Bay's biggest problem. There were dropped passes, several injuries along the offensive line that pressed defensive tackle Letroy Guion into duty at guard, and an awful showing by the defense, which hemorrhaged 493 yards.The Falcons knew they needed to get pressure on Rodgers, and cornerback Brian Poole tattooed him twice in the early going on slot blitzes, one of which left Rodgers begging referee Bill Vinovich for a flag, gesturing that he got hit in the face.Rodgers also had words with defensive tackle Grady Jarrett, who spun the two-time MVP around on a play officials were blowing dead, but didn’t take him to the ground.""Shoot, they (didn’t) dang blow the whistle until I got to him. But ain’t nobody worried about that,"" Jarrett said.Maturing Falcons defense saves best performance for Packers""They’re a team that gets away with a lot of stuff as far as holding calls and everything. So, when the thing isn’t going his way, when the game’s played fairly, it tends to be a problem.”By the time Rodgers took that face mask penalty against Alford in the fourth quarter, the Falcons led by 29 and the outcome was long decided.“When he’s done that,” Alford said, “all I could do was just smile and look at the scoreboard.”And, of course, flop.***Follow Tom Pelissero on Twitter @TomPelisseroPHOTOS: NFC Championship Game",0.0
357,"Lots of TVs.Everywhere, and at all times.Even during games. Especially during games.Like, an obscene amount of TVs for an audience obsessively addicted to college football on television.Watch parties before games. Watch parties after games. Watch parties all day during Saturdays in the fall.Birmingham leaders are in the process of designing the city's new downtown football stadium around its Uptown entertainment district, and they know the first thing they have to get right is the television experience. Birmingham is Football City, U.S.A., when it comes to local TV ratings, and, according to UAB football coach Bill Clark, designing a stadium to celebrate and foster that unique distinction is part of the initial plan.And it has to be.Football City, U.S.A., deserves nothing less.Clark and UAB held its preseason media day on Wednesday, and the Blazers' coach radiated with excitement about the city's new stadium. Clark and UAB director of athletics Mark Ingram recently presented their ideas for the stadium to the BJCC Authority, and UAB's football coach called the planning session ""two hours of anything you can think of.""A few years ago, he was a coach without a team. Now he's a coach helping design a downtown stadium.What a remarkable ride, and with 20 returning starters this season the team expects big things after last year's record-breaking, eight-win return to football. How the stadium affects UAB's future growth is anyone's guess, but this at least puts the program in a position to succeed and sell more season tickets. Stuck at Legion Field, UAB would have had no chance for long-term sustainability.UAB signed a 20-year lease for the new stadium in the offseason, and the Southside Dragons will be the venue's main tenant. Construction is scheduled to begin before the end of the year, and the stadium should be completed before the 2021 season.""We talked about everything, and they were open to anything, so I could not have been more pleased with how they treated us,"" Clark said.Among other things, Clark and Ingram emphasized technology, concessions and, of course, a fun environment for students. Legion Field lacks all of those things.The geography of the stadium's footprint against downtown's hilly northside could give architects the ability to create a unique stadium experience, Clark said. The designs haven't been finalized, but city leaders have talked about incorporating a viewing area from Uptown that looks into the stadium.""Iconic,"" Clark said.And hopefully filled with TVs and videoboards big and small to feed Birmingham's appetite for college football. The sport is Birmingham's great passion, and watching college football -- all day -- is what people in Birmingham do on Saturdays in the fall.We all know the numbers by now.Birmingham is the No.1 television market in the country for college football, and it's not even close. It has been that way now going on 17-straight years. In 2017, the difference in ESPN's ratings between Birmingham (6.8) and the No.2 market, Columbus, Ohio, (5.0) was almost as large as the difference between Columbus and the No.10 markets on the list, Dayton, Ohio, and New Orleans (3.1).The city hopes a smart design can create a complete game-day experience for fans of all teams. That thinking is aligned with Clark's plan for building UAB's fanbase. UAB has a solid core of dedicated fans -- it led CUSA in attendance last year -- but Clark and city leaders want the new stadium to cater to Alabama and Auburn fans who consider UAB their second team.That's the large majority of football fans in the city.There are plenty of UAB grads, employees, students and football fans in Birmingham, but many of them are fans of other teams, too. If given a choice between staying home and watching Alabama and Auburn, or going to Legion Field and watching UAB, well, that's not much of a choice at all.Getting those fans to the Uptown district on UAB game days is Clark's goal. It shouldn't be a tough sell.""It's not an us or them mentality we're trying to build here,"" Clark said. ""It's them, and us, too.""Watch Alabama and Auburn on the videoboard while you watch UAB on the field. Why not?UAB isn't interested in pulling fans of Alabama and Auburn away from their beloved teams. That's a losing battle, and counterproductive. Being everyone's second team in the No.1 city for college football is a good place to be.Joseph Goodman is a columnist for Alabama Media Group. He's on Twitter.",0.0
